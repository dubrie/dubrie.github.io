Overall Winner @ - Improper distance","title":"Adventure Races"},{"location":"tenets/","text":"Tenets Tenets are my principles or doctrines that I aim to live my life by. By nature these change over time as priorities in my life change, I grow as a person, or when something is not benefiting or working towards a positive goal. I am following an OKR format to make this more tangible as I work through the tenet progression of Hypothesis, Pattern, and Philosophy. An Hypothesis is something that I have theory about and am looking to prove out one way or another. If an Hypothesis is proven true, it becomes a Pattern that I add to my routine and establish on a more integrated level. If patterns prove to be valuable over a long period of time, then they become a Principle as something that is present and accounted for in my decision making, both actively and passively. 2023 Personal OKRs Note: I wrote more about these goals if you are curious about the \"why\" or some of the specific numbers. Objective: Invest more in myself Read 12 books with completed write-ups on GitHub Invest 21% of net income Increase disposable income by 10% by reducing expenses and subscription services Complete a meditation session on every \"T\" Objective: Reduce reliance on modern conveniences Drive to work no more than 1 time per month 50% of completed books were first published before the 1900s One meal per week uses something from our garden (during the growing season) Use only reclaimed water for the garden Objective: Take proactive steps to improve the world Abate 5 of the 10 biggest energy hogs in our household Explore 12 new local trails or parks Volunteer 4 times with local outdoor-focused groups Directly fund and/or invest in 3 carbon abatement or reduction projects OKR Reviews Mid Year 2023 2022 Yearly Results 2021 Yearly Results Established Principles Something I have whole-heartedly bought into and is a driving influence in all of my active and passive decision making. Measure, Compare, Adjust Create feedback loops everywhere I can including my own Philosophies, Beliefs, etc. Write things down as a commitment to them, measure progress, compare changes, adjust to maximize benefits and minimize negatives. Inspiration: James Clear Sweat Once A Day Go for a run, take the stairs to/from your office or home, dance, do push-ups or sit-ups during television commercials, whatever it is you enjoy that makes you sweat - do it everyday. Inspiration: Matthew McConaughey Read 30 Minutes A Day It's rumored that Winston Churchill read a book every night because it helped him think better overall. I've found that when I make the space to read, especially long-format, it helps focus my thoughts and attention. Inspiration: Winston Churchill Show Up, Work Hard, Listen, Do What You Say You Are Going To Do I've subconsiously lived by these 4 rules but never had it put as succinctly as this until I heard Jim Harbaugh say it and saw it written on a wall in the University of Michigan football locker room. The best part for me is that none of these skills require talent or things outside of your control, just commitment and work ethic.

By nature these change over time as priorities in my life change, I grow as a person, or when something is not benefiting or working towards a positive goal. I am following an OKR format to make this more tangible as I work through the tenet progression of Hypothesis, Pattern, and Philosophy. An Hypothesis is something that I have theory about and am looking to prove out one way or another. If an Hypothesis is proven true, it becomes a Pattern that I add to my routine and establish on a more integrated level. If patterns prove to be valuable over a long period of time, then they become a Principle as something that is present and accounted for in my decision making, both actively and passively.","title":"Tenets"},{"location":"tenets/#2023-personal-okrs","text":"Note: I wrote more about these goals if you are curious about the \"why\" or some of the specific numbers.","title":"2023 Personal OKRs"},{"location":"tenets/#objective-invest-more-in-myself","text":"Read 12 books with completed write-ups on GitHub Invest 21% of net income Increase disposable income by 10% by reducing expenses and subscription services Complete a meditation session on every \"T\"","title":"Objective: Invest more in myself"},{"location":"tenets/#objective-reduce-reliance-on-modern-conveniences","text":"Drive to work no more than 1 time per month 50% of completed books were first published before the 1900s One meal per week uses something from our garden (during the growing season) Use only reclaimed water for the garden","title":"Objective: Reduce reliance on modern conveniences"},{"location":"tenets/#objective-take-proactive-steps-to-improve-the-world","text":"Abate 5 of the 10 biggest energy hogs in our household Explore 12 new local trails or parks Volunteer 4 times with local outdoor-focused groups Directly fund and/or invest in 3 carbon abatement or reduction projects","title":"Objective: Take proactive steps to improve the world"},{"location":"tenets/#okr-reviews","text":"Mid Year 2023 2022 Yearly Results 2021 Yearly Results","title":"OKR Reviews"},{"location":"tenets/#established-principles","text":"Something I have whole-heartedly bought into and is a driving influence in all of my active and passive decision making.

Inspiration: James Clear Sweat Once A Day Go for a run, take the stairs to/from your office or home, dance, do push-ups or sit-ups during television commercials, whatever it is you enjoy that makes you sweat - do it everyday. Inspiration: Matthew McConaughey Read 30 Minutes A Day It's rumored that Winston Churchill read a book every night because it helped him think better overall. I've found that when I make the space to read, especially long-format, it helps focus my thoughts and attention. Inspiration: Winston Churchill Show Up, Work Hard, Listen, Do What You Say You Are Going To Do I've subconsiously lived by these 4 rules but never had it put as succinctly as this until I heard Jim Harbaugh say it and saw it written on a wall in the University of Michigan football locker room. The best part for me is that none of these skills require talent or things outside of your control, just commitment and work ethic.

The majority of the focus was at the managers of managers level but there was a fair amount of information that can be applied to any level of engineering management like hiring, document writing, communicating with executives, project management, and a bunch of other stuff. Some highlights from my reading: 1. The key tools for leading efficient change are systems thinking, metrics, and vision. 2. Delivery lead time is the time from the creation of code to its use in production. Deployment frequency is how often you deploy code. 3. Change fail rate is how frequently changes fail. Time to restore service is the time spent recovering from defects. 4. The best cheap alternative that I\u2019ve found [for modeling] is Insight Maker, which has some UI quirks but features a donation-based payment model. 5. A structure that I\u2019ve found extremely effective is described in Good Strategy/Bad Strategy by Richard Rumelt, and has three sections: diagnosis, policies, and actions. 6. Start with the conclusion. Particularly in written communication, folks skim until they get bored and then stop reading. 7. [In written communication] providing a narrative of where things are, how you got here, and where you\u2019re going now. 8. My general approach to presenting to senior leaders is: * Tie topic to business value * Establish historical narrative * Explicit ask * Data-driven diagnosis * Decision-making principles * What's next and when it'll be done * Return to explicit ask 9. The next time you\u2019re about to dive into fixing a complicated one-off situation, consider taking a step back and documenting the problem but not trying to solve it.

The majority of the focus was at the managers of managers level but there was a fair amount of information that can be applied to any level of engineering management like hiring, document writing, communicating with executives, project management, and a bunch of other stuff. Some highlights from my reading: 1. The key tools for leading efficient change are systems thinking, metrics, and vision. 2. Delivery lead time is the time from the creation of code to its use in production. Deployment frequency is how often you deploy code. 3. Change fail rate is how frequently changes fail. Time to restore service is the time spent recovering from defects. 4. The best cheap alternative that I\u2019ve found [for modeling] is Insight Maker, which has some UI quirks but features a donation-based payment model. 5. A structure that I\u2019ve found extremely effective is described in Good Strategy/Bad Strategy by Richard Rumelt, and has three sections: diagnosis, policies, and actions. 6.

[In written communication] providing a narrative of where things are, how you got here, and where you\u2019re going now. 8.

I used the time in June to watch the Netflix documentary \"I Am Not Your Negro\" about James Baldwin's life. I knew the name but not much more and the documentary was not only incredibly well-done but very insightful into his life and starkly different approach (Compared to MLX and Malcom X) and involvement in the civil rights movement in the 1960s. I wanted to explore more about him and his life and this biography(?) came highly recommended. I say biography but I'm not sure it actually is in the traditional sense as This is more about the author (Eddie S. Glaude Jr.) and his journey and exploration through Baldwin's life and reactions to events juxtaposed to current (2019/2020) events and movements. The book does a very effective job of evoking the pain and passion while carefully dancing between the guarded optimism and pessimism through the decades and draws clear threads between the Reagan and Trump administrations and how The Lie has been perpetuated for centuries. Some highlights/thoughts from my reading: 1. \u201cIgnorance allied with power is the most ferocious enemy of justice.\u201d 1. In each instance the country chose to remain exactly what it was : a racist nation that claimed to be democratic . These were and are moments of national betrayal , in which the commitments of democracy are shunted off to the side to make way for , and to safely secure , a more fundamental commitment to race. 1. To accept one\u2019s past \u2014 one\u2019s history \u2014 is not the same thing as drowning in it ; it is learning how to use it . An invented past can never be used ; it cracks and crumbles under the pressures of life like clay in a season of drought . 1. cling to their hates so stubbornly is because they sense , once hate is gone , that they will be forced to deal with pain . \u201d 1. America , and its racist assumptions , had indelibly shaped who Baldwin was . But , he insisted , we are not the mere product of social forces . Each of us has a say in who we take ourselves to be . No matter what America said about him as a black person , Baldwin argued , he had the last word about who he was as a human being and as a black man . 1. This conclusion was the result of what Socrates called the examined life , and it served as the foundation for Baldwin\u2019s broader witness . Just as we must examine our individual experiences and the terrors that shape how we come to see ourselves , together as a country we must do the same . 1. These , then , are the twined purposes at the heart of Baldwin\u2019s poetic vision . He is not only motivated to transform the stuff of experience into the beauty of art ; as a poet he also bears witness to what he sees and what we have forgotten , calling our attention to the enduring legacies of slavery in our lives ; to the impact of systemic discrimination throughout the country that has denied generations of black people access to the so - called American dream ; to the willful blindness of so many white Americans to the violence that sustains it all . 1. His misremembering sought to orient us to the after times of the civil rights movement and to call attention to the trauma and terror that threatened everything . \u201c What one does not remember , \u201d he reminds the reader , \u201c is the serpent in the garden of one\u2019s dreams . \u201d 1. what shook Baldwin at his core was a \u201c realization of the nature of the heathen . \u201d The white southerner had to lie continuously to himself in order to justify his world . Lie that the black people around him were inferior . Lie about what he was doing under the cover of night . Lie that he was Christian . 1. Exceptionalizing Trump deforms our attention ( it becomes difficult to see what is happening right in front of us ) and secures our self - understanding from anything he might actually represent . If anything , Trump represents a reassertion of the belief that America is , and will always be , a white nation . 1. I\u2019m not trying to accuse you , you know . That\u2019s not the point . But you have a lot to face \u2026 . All that can save you now is your confrontation with your own history \u2026 which is not your past , but your present . Nobody cares what happened in the past . One can\u2019t afford to care what happened in the past . But your history has led you to this moment , and you can only begin to change yourself and save yourself by looking at what you are doing in the name of your history . 1. They showed that the statues were not erected as contemporaneous historical memorials of the Civil War . Most were built many years later , either between the 1890s and the first decades of the twentieth century ( when most of the Confederate veterans began to die ) or in the 1950s , with the demand for racial equality intensifying . They were monuments to an ideology \u2014 physical representations of the superiority of white people and a way of life that reflected that fact . 1. In that same issue of Black Panther , Eldridge Cleaver , the party\u2019s minister of information , penned a damning screed against the NAACP entitled \u201c Old Toms Never Die Unless They are Blown Away . \u201d 1. since white Americans did not seem to view the issue of race in moral terms . In fact , white people seemed to give less than a damn about the sinfulness of racism . Power was at the heart of the matter 1. Despite their claims of commitment to racial justice , Baldwin saw them , in their actions , as co - conspirators in maintaining the belief that white people mattered more than others . White liberals weren\u2019t loud racists . They were simply racial philanthropists who , after a good deed , return to their suburban homes with their white picket fences or to their apartments in segregated cities with their consciences content . Baldwin was not shy about calling this out . 1. I don\u2019t want anybody working with me because they are doing something for me 1. The fact of growing up , of coming of age , in a place that holds all sorts of negative stereotypes about who you are and what you are capable of , along with the country\u2019s racist history of torture , rape , and murder and its supposed ideals of democracy \u2014 all of it inevitably distorts your sense of self . 1. We have invented the nigger . I didn\u2019t invent him ; white people invented him . I\u2019ve always known , I had to know by the time I was 17 years old , that what you were describing was not me and what you were afraid of was not me . It had to be something else , you had invented it so it had to be something you were afraid of and you invested me with \u2026 . I\u2019ve always known that I am not a nigger . But , if I am not the nigger , and if it\u2019s true that your invention reveals you , then who is the nigger ? I am not the victim here \u2026 . So I give you your problem back . You\u2019re the nigger , baby , it isn\u2019t me . 1. This is Baldwin\u2019s revolutionary act : to shift or invert the \u201c white man\u2019s burden . \u201d The problem is not us . Instead Americans must understand as best we can , because our lives depend on it , the consequences of this deadly projection . Through this lens , the \u201c black man\u2019s burden \u201d is the brutal behavior of white people in thrall to a lie . 1. These are the voters left behind by a Democratic Party catering to so - called identity politics \u2014 as if talking about a living wage and healthcare as a right , or affordable education , or equal pay for women , or equal rights for the LGBTQ community , or a fair criminal justice system , somehow excludes working - class white people 1. In our after times , our task , then , is not to save Trump voters \u2014 it isn\u2019t to convince them to give up their views that white people ought to matter more than others . Our task is to build a world where such a view has no place or quarter to breathe . 1. Elsewhere is that physical or metaphorical place that affords the space to breathe , to refuse adjustment and accommodation to the demands of society , and to live apart , if just for a time , from the deadly assumptions that threaten to smother . Living elsewhere can offer you a moment of rest , to catch your breath and ready yourself to enter the fray once again , not so much whole and healed , but battle - scarred and prepared for yet another round 1. I\u2019m not French , though I lived in France a long time , and loved it . I learned things about France while I was there , but what I mainly learned was about my own country , my own past , and about my own language . 1. The moral stamina to fight this fight requires that we cultivate our own elsewhere , because the one \u201c who finds no way to rest cannot long survive the battle , \u201d and this battle of ours isn\u2019t going to end soon . Baldwin\u2019s time in Istanbul taught me that . 1. it entails moving \u201c away from the centralizing authorities toward the margins , where you see things that are usually lost 1. many white Americans who suffered , whether they lived in cities or in the suburbs , blamed the troubles of the nation on the tumult of the sixties revolution and the black people who were at the center of it all . 1. \u201c the spirit of the South has not changed \u2026 . The spirit of the South is the spirit of America . \u201d On one level , America and the South are one and the same , both are haunted and vexed by the macabre reality of the dead , the suffering beneath the country\u2019s and region\u2019s feet , and by the lie of their innocent role in it all . That innocence allowed the bodies to continue to amass . 1. The seventies involved a confrontation with a frightening truth : that despite the sacrifices and costs of the black freedom struggle , the country remained profoundly racist and , no matter its proclamations to the contrary , white America was perfectly comfortable with that fact . 1. Reagan had argued that Americans could escape poor living conditions if they so chose . All they needed to do was to \u201c vote with their feet . \u201d They could just move along . Those who remained , he seemed to suggest , did so because they wanted to or were too lazy to aspire to something more . This was the lie . 1. voting , as much as it is a democratic duty , for black people , can also be a means to buy some time when the choice is as stark as it was between Carter and Reagan . 1. As with Reagan in 1980 , with Trump white America reached for an image \u2014 a Hollywood - generated fantasy \u2014 on which to project their hatreds and fears . In this sense , Trump is best seen as a child of Reagan . 1. Americans are always sincere , it is their most striking and appalling attribute \u2026 . Nixon was perfectly sincere when lying about Watergate , the military were perfectly sincere when lying about Vietnam and Cambodia , Helms is perfectly sincere when he says that he is not a racist , and the late J . Edgar Hoover was sincere when he called the late Martin Luther King , Jr . the biggest liar in America . This sincerity covers , and pardons all , [ and ] is the very substance of the American panic . 1. Ask any Mexican , any Puerto Rican , any black man , any poor person \u2014 ask the wretched how they fare in the halls of justice , and then you will know , not whether or not the country is just , but whether or not it has any love for justice , or any concept of it . It is certain , in any case , that ignorance , allied with power , is the most ferocious enemy justice can have . 1. Baldwin\u2019s view of American history . The past is not past ; \u201c history is literally present in all we do , \u201d 1. National Memorial for Peace and Justice represents a traumatic history , and it isn\u2019t easily forgotten , if at all . Our bodies carry the traumas forward . The history of racial trauma lives on and moves us about in ways we often don\u2019t realize . It grounds our fears and , whether we know it or not , it affects our dreams . In places all over the South and the country , the legacy of this terror and trauma continues to haunt . The memorial confronts the trauma directly and offers us , in its own way , a chance to begin again . 1. I do believe in truth and reconciliation . I just think that truth and reconciliation are sequential : That you can\u2019t have reconciliation without the truth . 1. we reexamine the fundamental values and commitments that shape our self - understanding , and that we look back to those beginnings not to reaffirm our greatness or to double down on myths that secure our innocence , but to see where we went wrong and how we might reimagine or re - create ourselves in light of who we initially set out to be . This 1. Baldwin ended his talk with a powerful admonition , a preface as it were to a last will and testament : We are living in a world in which everybody and everything is interdependent . It is not white , this world . It is not black either . The future of this world depends on everyone in this room . And that future depends on to what extent and by what means we liberate ourselves from a vocabulary which now cannot bear the weight of reality . Liberation from the languages and categories that box us in requires that we tap the source of it all , free ourselves of the lie , and start this whole damn thing over . 1. \u201c An old world is dying , and a new one , kicking in the belly of its mother , time , announces that it is ready to be born . This birth will not be easy , and many of us are doomed to discover that we are exceedingly clumsy midwives . No matter , so long as we accept that our responsibility is to the newborn : the acceptance of responsibility contains the key . \u201d That was 1972 . The labor has been long and hard , and the new world has yet to be born . We are now in our after times , but responsibility has not been lost . Whatever happens next will be up to us . 1. But , in the end , he wanted us to see that whiteness as an identity was a moral choice , an attitude toward the world based on ugly things .","title":"Review of Begin Again: James Baldwin's America and Its Urgent Lessons for Our Own"},{"location":"archive/books/begin-again/#review-of-begin-again-james-baldwins-america-and-its-urgent-lessons-for-our-own","text":"Book Link: Amazon (smile) My company provides Juneteenth not as a holiday (yet), but as a day of reflection, listening, and learning.

The book does a very effective job of evoking the pain and passion while carefully dancing between the guarded optimism and pessimism through the decades and draws clear threads between the Reagan and Trump administrations and how The Lie has been perpetuated for centuries. Some highlights/thoughts from my reading: 1. \u201cIgnorance allied with power is the most ferocious enemy of justice.\u201d 1. In each instance the country chose to remain exactly what it was : a racist nation that claimed to be democratic . These were and are moments of national betrayal , in which the commitments of democracy are shunted off to the side to make way for , and to safely secure , a more fundamental commitment to race. 1. To accept one\u2019s past \u2014 one\u2019s history \u2014 is not the same thing as drowning in it ; it is learning how to use it . An invented past can never be used ; it cracks and crumbles under the pressures of life like clay in a season of drought . 1. cling to their hates so stubbornly is because they sense , once hate is gone , that they will be forced to deal with pain . \u201d 1. America , and its racist assumptions , had indelibly shaped who Baldwin was . But , he insisted , we are not the mere product of social forces . Each of us has a say in who we take ourselves to be . No matter what America said about him as a black person , Baldwin argued , he had the last word about who he was as a human being and as a black man . 1. This conclusion was the result of what Socrates called the examined life , and it served as the foundation for Baldwin\u2019s broader witness . Just as we must examine our individual experiences and the terrors that shape how we come to see ourselves , together as a country we must do the same . 1. These , then , are the twined purposes at the heart of Baldwin\u2019s poetic vision . He is not only motivated to transform the stuff of experience into the beauty of art ; as a poet he also bears witness to what he sees and what we have forgotten , calling our attention to the enduring legacies of slavery in our lives ; to the impact of systemic discrimination throughout the country that has denied generations of black people access to the so - called American dream ; to the willful blindness of so many white Americans to the violence that sustains it all . 1. His misremembering sought to orient us to the after times of the civil rights movement and to call attention to the trauma and terror that threatened everything . \u201c What one does not remember , \u201d he reminds the reader , \u201c is the serpent in the garden of one\u2019s dreams . \u201d 1. what shook Baldwin at his core was a \u201c realization of the nature of the heathen . \u201d The white southerner had to lie continuously to himself in order to justify his world . Lie that the black people around him were inferior . Lie about what he was doing under the cover of night . Lie that he was Christian . 1. Exceptionalizing Trump deforms our attention ( it becomes difficult to see what is happening right in front of us ) and secures our self - understanding from anything he might actually represent . If anything , Trump represents a reassertion of the belief that America is , and will always be , a white nation . 1. I\u2019m not trying to accuse you , you know . That\u2019s not the point . But you have a lot to face \u2026 . All that can save you now is your confrontation with your own history \u2026 which is not your past , but your present . Nobody cares what happened in the past . One can\u2019t afford to care what happened in the past . But your history has led you to this moment , and you can only begin to change yourself and save yourself by looking at what you are doing in the name of your history . 1. They showed that the statues were not erected as contemporaneous historical memorials of the Civil War . Most were built many years later , either between the 1890s and the first decades of the twentieth century ( when most of the Confederate veterans began to die ) or in the 1950s , with the demand for racial equality intensifying . They were monuments to an ideology \u2014 physical representations of the superiority of white people and a way of life that reflected that fact . 1. In that same issue of Black Panther , Eldridge Cleaver , the party\u2019s minister of information , penned a damning screed against the NAACP entitled \u201c Old Toms Never Die Unless They are Blown Away . \u201d 1. since white Americans did not seem to view the issue of race in moral terms . In fact , white people seemed to give less than a damn about the sinfulness of racism . Power was at the heart of the matter 1. Despite their claims of commitment to racial justice , Baldwin saw them , in their actions , as co - conspirators in maintaining the belief that white people mattered more than others . White liberals weren\u2019t loud racists . They were simply racial philanthropists who , after a good deed , return to their suburban homes with their white picket fences or to their apartments in segregated cities with their consciences content . Baldwin was not shy about calling this out . 1. I don\u2019t want anybody working with me because they are doing something for me 1. The fact of growing up , of coming of age , in a place that holds all sorts of negative stereotypes about who you are and what you are capable of , along with the country\u2019s racist history of torture , rape , and murder and its supposed ideals of democracy \u2014 all of it inevitably distorts your sense of self . 1. We have invented the nigger . I didn\u2019t invent him ; white people invented him . I\u2019ve always known , I had to know by the time I was 17 years old , that what you were describing was not me and what you were afraid of was not me . It had to be something else , you had invented it so it had to be something you were afraid of and you invested me with \u2026 . I\u2019ve always known that I am not a nigger . But , if I am not the nigger , and if it\u2019s true that your invention reveals you , then who is the nigger ? I am not the victim here \u2026 . So I give you your problem back . You\u2019re the nigger , baby , it isn\u2019t me . 1. This is Baldwin\u2019s revolutionary act : to shift or invert the \u201c white man\u2019s burden . \u201d The problem is not us . Instead Americans must understand as best we can , because our lives depend on it , the consequences of this deadly projection . Through this lens , the \u201c black man\u2019s burden \u201d is the brutal behavior of white people in thrall to a lie . 1. These are the voters left behind by a Democratic Party catering to so - called identity politics \u2014 as if talking about a living wage and healthcare as a right , or affordable education , or equal pay for women , or equal rights for the LGBTQ community , or a fair criminal justice system , somehow excludes working - class white people 1. In our after times , our task , then , is not to save Trump voters \u2014 it isn\u2019t to convince them to give up their views that white people ought to matter more than others . Our task is to build a world where such a view has no place or quarter to breathe . 1. Elsewhere is that physical or metaphorical place that affords the space to breathe , to refuse adjustment and accommodation to the demands of society , and to live apart , if just for a time , from the deadly assumptions that threaten to smother . Living elsewhere can offer you a moment of rest , to catch your breath and ready yourself to enter the fray once again , not so much whole and healed , but battle - scarred and prepared for yet another round 1. I\u2019m not French , though I lived in France a long time , and loved it . I learned things about France while I was there , but what I mainly learned was about my own country , my own past , and about my own language . 1. The moral stamina to fight this fight requires that we cultivate our own elsewhere , because the one \u201c who finds no way to rest cannot long survive the battle , \u201d and this battle of ours isn\u2019t going to end soon . Baldwin\u2019s time in Istanbul taught me that . 1. it entails moving \u201c away from the centralizing authorities toward the margins , where you see things that are usually lost 1. many white Americans who suffered , whether they lived in cities or in the suburbs , blamed the troubles of the nation on the tumult of the sixties revolution and the black people who were at the center of it all . 1. \u201c the spirit of the South has not changed \u2026 . The spirit of the South is the spirit of America . \u201d On one level , America and the South are one and the same , both are haunted and vexed by the macabre reality of the dead , the suffering beneath the country\u2019s and region\u2019s feet , and by the lie of their innocent role in it all . That innocence allowed the bodies to continue to amass . 1. The seventies involved a confrontation with a frightening truth : that despite the sacrifices and costs of the black freedom struggle , the country remained profoundly racist and , no matter its proclamations to the contrary , white America was perfectly comfortable with that fact . 1. Reagan had argued that Americans could escape poor living conditions if they so chose . All they needed to do was to \u201c vote with their feet . \u201d They could just move along . Those who remained , he seemed to suggest , did so because they wanted to or were too lazy to aspire to something more . This was the lie . 1. voting , as much as it is a democratic duty , for black people , can also be a means to buy some time when the choice is as stark as it was between Carter and Reagan . 1. As with Reagan in 1980 , with Trump white America reached for an image \u2014 a Hollywood - generated fantasy \u2014 on which to project their hatreds and fears . In this sense , Trump is best seen as a child of Reagan . 1. Americans are always sincere , it is their most striking and appalling attribute \u2026 . Nixon was perfectly sincere when lying about Watergate , the military were perfectly sincere when lying about Vietnam and Cambodia , Helms is perfectly sincere when he says that he is not a racist , and the late J . Edgar Hoover was sincere when he called the late Martin Luther King , Jr . the biggest liar in America . This sincerity covers , and pardons all , [ and ] is the very substance of the American panic . 1. Ask any Mexican , any Puerto Rican , any black man , any poor person \u2014 ask the wretched how they fare in the halls of justice , and then you will know , not whether or not the country is just , but whether or not it has any love for justice , or any concept of it . It is certain , in any case , that ignorance , allied with power , is the most ferocious enemy justice can have . 1. Baldwin\u2019s view of American history . The past is not past ; \u201c history is literally present in all we do , \u201d 1. National Memorial for Peace and Justice represents a traumatic history , and it isn\u2019t easily forgotten , if at all . Our bodies carry the traumas forward . The history of racial trauma lives on and moves us about in ways we often don\u2019t realize . It grounds our fears and , whether we know it or not , it affects our dreams . In places all over the South and the country , the legacy of this terror and trauma continues to haunt . The memorial confronts the trauma directly and offers us , in its own way , a chance to begin again . 1. I do believe in truth and reconciliation . I just think that truth and reconciliation are sequential : That you can\u2019t have reconciliation without the truth . 1. we reexamine the fundamental values and commitments that shape our self - understanding , and that we look back to those beginnings not to reaffirm our greatness or to double down on myths that secure our innocence , but to see where we went wrong and how we might reimagine or re - create ourselves in light of who we initially set out to be . This 1. Baldwin ended his talk with a powerful admonition , a preface as it were to a last will and testament : We are living in a world in which everybody and everything is interdependent . It is not white , this world . It is not black either . The future of this world depends on everyone in this room . And that future depends on to what extent and by what means we liberate ourselves from a vocabulary which now cannot bear the weight of reality . Liberation from the languages and categories that box us in requires that we tap the source of it all , free ourselves of the lie , and start this whole damn thing over . 1. \u201c An old world is dying , and a new one , kicking in the belly of its mother , time , announces that it is ready to be born . This birth will not be easy , and many of us are doomed to discover that we are exceedingly clumsy midwives . No matter , so long as we accept that our responsibility is to the newborn : the acceptance of responsibility contains the key . \u201d That was 1972 . The labor has been long and hard , and the new world has yet to be born . We are now in our after times , but responsibility has not been lost . Whatever happens next will be up to us . 1. But , in the end , he wanted us to see that whiteness as an identity was a moral choice , an attitude toward the world based on ugly things .","title":"Review of Begin Again: James Baldwin's America and Its Urgent Lessons for Our Own"},{"location":"archive/books/building-green-software/","text":"Review of Building Green Software Book Link: https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/building-green-software/9781098150617/ While this book is not officially released yet, I was fortunate enough to be selected as a Technical Reviewer by O'Reilly for it so I've been able to read through the entire thing already.

This book takes that mindset and puts a proactive spin on it to allow people to best navigate obstacles they come against. To be clear, I don't think this book does a great job of actually TEACHING you to do that (there are others out there that can), but does lay out some good anecdotal and scientific reasons as to why that is the correct approach for you in the long run. I really liked how this was anchored in running and fitness but provided lots of examples outside that area with Navy SEALS, corporate and business, stock trading, behavior science, and just little actions and thoughts you can use throughout your day. My takeaway here is a new definiton of toughness which is: Toughness is being mindful with knowning and attempting different approches to best navigate discomfort and repeatedly make the best decision you can. Bulldozing or \"powering\" through may work in short bursts but will not sustain and often is harmful in the long run. While reading, I noticed a few behaviors I have that already aligned to this approach. For example, when gambling at craps tables I focus on my gut feelings and intuition (and a little math). It doesn\u2019t always work out but seems to follow the Pareto distribution pretty closely. Interestingly, if I start drinking the free booze they keep pushing on you, I have consistently performed worse in my judgement so I stay away from it entirely. I took a lot away from this book, even if it was mostly reinforcing my existing beliefs and patterns. I think this is a good read to help put some structure and science behind a mindful approach to everything in your life. Some highlights from my reading: 1. Rhabdomyolysis (or rhabdo for short) is a once-rare condition where damaged muscle products leak into the bloodstream, putting an unusual demand on the kidneys to process it all. In extreme cases, death can occur. A disease once primarily caused by infections or drug use has transformed into a somewhat common occurrence, thanks to a bevy of cases caused by extreme workouts. Endless push-ups, squats, burpees, and other exercises designed not to improve fitness, but to \u201ctest\u201d their athletes. 2. The authoritarian style creates the appearance of discipline without actually fostering it. 3. Instead, real toughness is experiencing discomfort or distress, leaning in, paying attention, and creating space to take thoughtful action. It\u2019s maintaining a clear head to be able to make the appropriate decision. Toughness is navigating discomfort to make the best decision you can. And research shows that this model of toughness is more effective at getting results than the old one. 4. Whether discomfort comes in the form of anxiety, fear, pain, uncertainty, or fatigue, navigating through it is what toughness is all about. Not bulldozing or pushing through, but navigating. Sometimes that means going through, around, under, or waiting until it passes. When we frame toughness as a decision to act under discomfort, it allows us to see that toughness is far more than merely having grit or grinding through. 5. Real toughness is experiencing discomfort or distress, leaning in, paying attention, and creating space to take thoughtful action. It\u2019s navigating discomfort to make the best decision you can. 6. As podcaster Rich Roll told me in summarizing the hundreds of interviews he\u2019s conducted, \u201cEverybody goes through shit in their life. Nobody escapes obstacles.\u201d If we\u2019re going to face obstacles, we might as well figure out the best way to navigate them. 7. As of 2018, the US Army is the largest employer of sports psychologists in the country. 8. In other words, you need to teach the skill first. Even the vaunted Navy SEALs recognized this distinction when in the early 2000s, they implemented a classroom phase designed to train candidates how \u201cto monitor their psychological performance and learn to maximize mental toughness skills.\u201d 9. Does our appraisal of our skills match our appraisal of the demands of the situation? This mismatch between situational demands and our capacity to cope doesn\u2019t just determine running performance; it determines what kind of response to stress we\u2019ll have. 10. Our appraisal of a situation as a threat or as a challenge depends on the perceived demands of that stressor versus our perceived abilities to handle them. Do we have the resources to handle the demands? 11. The ones who said, \u2018Here\u2019s what I\u2019m capable of. Here\u2019s what the race demands. I\u2019m going to execute based on those two things.\u2019 Those are the ones who consistently perform.\u201d 12. Embrace reality. Accurate appraisal of demands + accurate appraisal of our abilities. 13. In the workplace, research shows false confidence can fool those who are uninformed on a subject, but those with even a moderate understanding of the topic will sniff out your lack of acumen. In situations that demand toughness, false confidence largely fails. 14. To develop true, inner confidence, there are four steps: Lower the bar. Raise the floor. Shed perfection. Embrace who you are. Trust your training. Trust yourself. Develop a quiet ego. 15. Take away control, and animals resign themselves to their fate. They give up. Even if the path to avoiding despair is right in front of them. 16. sufferers of give-up-itis progress through a series of five stages. It starts with a general withdrawal before turning into apathy, loss of emotional response, and a lack of response to any external stimulus. Along the way, motivation to do menial tasks erodes until the simplest of tasks can no longer be completed. Listlessness takes over. The last stage is psychogenic death. 17. Our level of control changes how we respond to stress. When we have a sense of control, our alarm is quieter and easier to shut off. 18. Too often, we get stuck in the rut of apathy, because we haven\u2019t flexed our hopeful muscle. Small actions that remind you that you have a choice go a long way to training the ability to put your brain back online. 19. \u201cWhat concerns us, therefore, is how effective a training plan can ever be if the body in the stands\u2014the coach\u2014not the body on the track\u2014the athlete\u2014is in total control of the training process?\u201d 20. When we don\u2019t have control, we lose the capacity to cope. It\u2019s when we have a choice that toughness is trained. 21. In two studies out of Europe, a group of psychologists found that individuals who were clear about their feelings, understanding where they came from and what they meant, were more likely to thrive under stress, anxiety, and pressure. They turned anxiety into excitement and pressure into information and motivation. All thanks to clarity on the message their body was sending. 22. It wasn\u2019t the traders with the better credentials who excelled at making risky decisions; it was the ones who could read their body. 23. It\u2019s not whether our inner voice is an optimist or a pessimist. It\u2019s whether it\u2019s fair. If we find our internal negativity holding us back, or our eternally optimistic \u201cYou can do it!\u201d voice getting in the way of our seeing reality, we need to broaden our experience. 24. Respond to reality. For most of us, we are not only responding to the actual stress but the reverberations of it. Tough individuals learn to match perception with reality so that they marshal the appropriate response instead of an exaggerated one. 25. lessons from the extremes help illustrate the adage: the dose makes the poison. 26. \u201cA spiritual virtue, upekkha means equanimity in the face of the fluctuations of worldly fortune. It is evenness of mind, unshakeable freedom of mind, a state of inner equipoise that cannot be upset by gain and loss, honor and dishonor, praise and blame, pleasure and pain.\u201d 27. In his book Transcend, Scott Barry Kaufman, defined equanimity as \u201ca cultivation of mindfulness and observation, of not pursuing one\u2019s purpose with blinders on but constantly being open to new information, constantly seeking wisdom and honest awareness of reality, and constantly monitoring your progress and impact on your own personal growth as well as the impact on others. . . . Radiating warmth and openness as you encounter the inevitable stressors of life.\u201d 28. \u201cMood follows action.\u201d When we\u2019re feeling sad and down, trying to alter our mood seldom works. But if instead of trying to force your mood to change you change your behavior\u2014getting out of bed and going for a walk\u2014you often find yourself in a much better, happier place. 29. I tried lots of different healing and therapies, some worked a little, others did not, but really what worked for me was running. Moving on my own two feet through the wilderness,\u201d she relayed. Being alone in her head \u201cwas the only time I could move beyond my fear thoughts. At the start of every run, my anxiety was super heightened, but as I ran, that rhythmic repetition lulled me into a moving meditation where the thoughts dropped away. And a realization that the body was strong. The body holds the wisdom, it was sending a message, \u2018Actually, you\u2019re healthy, Katie.\u2019\u201d 30. The best performers tend to have a flexible and adaptive coping ability. They can bounce between different strategies, depending on the demands of the situation. 31. Cultivating an environment that allows for progress and competence has the following characteristics: A challenging but supportive environment The ability to take risks and voice your opinion without fear being the dominant motivator A path that shows the way for growth and improvement in your job or field 32. The basic building blocks of being a healthy, functioning human are the same ones that enable us to handle tough situations. 33. When we explore instead of avoid, we are able to integrate the experience into our story. We\u2019re able to make meaning out of struggle, out of suffering. Meaning is the glue that holds our mind together, allowing us to both respond and recover. 34. Real toughness is living in the nuance and complexity of the environment, bodies, and minds we inhabit.","title":"Review of Do Hard Things"},{"location":"archive/books/do-hard-things/#review-of-do-hard-things","text":"Book Link: https://smile.amazon.com/Hard-Things-Resilience-Surprising-Toughness/dp/006309861X/ I've long held the belief that everyone has their own shit that they go through and often they are constantly going through it. This book takes that mindset and puts a proactive spin on it to allow people to best navigate obstacles they come against. To be clear, I don't think this book does a great job of actually TEACHING you to do that (there are others out there that can), but does lay out some good anecdotal and scientific reasons as to why that is the correct approach for you in the long run. I really liked how this was anchored in running and fitness but provided lots of examples outside that area with Navy SEALS, corporate and business, stock trading, behavior science, and just little actions and thoughts you can use throughout your day. My takeaway here is a new definiton of toughness which is: Toughness is being mindful with knowning and attempting different approches to best navigate discomfort and repeatedly make the best decision you can. Bulldozing or \"powering\" through may work in short bursts but will not sustain and often is harmful in the long run. While reading, I noticed a few behaviors I have that already aligned to this approach. For example, when gambling at craps tables I focus on my gut feelings and intuition (and a little math). It doesn\u2019t always work out but seems to follow the Pareto distribution pretty closely. Interestingly, if I start drinking the free booze they keep pushing on you, I have consistently performed worse in my judgement so I stay away from it entirely. I took a lot away from this book, even if it was mostly reinforcing my existing beliefs and patterns. I think this is a good read to help put some structure and science behind a mindful approach to everything in your life. Some highlights from my reading: 1. Rhabdomyolysis (or rhabdo for short) is a once-rare condition where damaged muscle products leak into the bloodstream, putting an unusual demand on the kidneys to process it all. In extreme cases, death can occur. A disease once primarily caused by infections or drug use has transformed into a somewhat common occurrence, thanks to a bevy of cases caused by extreme workouts. Endless push-ups, squats, burpees, and other exercises designed not to improve fitness, but to \u201ctest\u201d their athletes. 2. The authoritarian style creates the appearance of discipline without actually fostering it. 3. Instead, real toughness is experiencing discomfort or distress, leaning in, paying attention, and creating space to take thoughtful action. It\u2019s maintaining a clear head to be able to make the appropriate decision. Toughness is navigating discomfort to make the best decision you can. And research shows that this model of toughness is more effective at getting results than the old one. 4. Whether discomfort comes in the form of anxiety, fear, pain, uncertainty, or fatigue, navigating through it is what toughness is all about. Not bulldozing or pushing through, but navigating. Sometimes that means going through, around, under, or waiting until it passes. When we frame toughness as a decision to act under discomfort, it allows us to see that toughness is far more than merely having grit or grinding through. 5. Real toughness is experiencing discomfort or distress, leaning in, paying attention, and creating space to take thoughtful action. It\u2019s navigating discomfort to make the best decision you can. 6. As podcaster Rich Roll told me in summarizing the hundreds of interviews he\u2019s conducted, \u201cEverybody goes through shit in their life. Nobody escapes obstacles.\u201d If we\u2019re going to face obstacles, we might as well figure out the best way to navigate them. 7. As of 2018, the US Army is the largest employer of sports psychologists in the country. 8. In other words, you need to teach the skill first. Even the vaunted Navy SEALs recognized this distinction when in the early 2000s, they implemented a classroom phase designed to train candidates how \u201cto monitor their psychological performance and learn to maximize mental toughness skills.\u201d 9. Does our appraisal of our skills match our appraisal of the demands of the situation? This mismatch between situational demands and our capacity to cope doesn\u2019t just determine running performance; it determines what kind of response to stress we\u2019ll have. 10.

Which sounds like you could go skiing naked if you got a good hat.\u201d (link) and that is similar to what I feel this book is trying to say: The brain controls how and when your body gives up so training the brain has the best impact on performance. In reality, it's much more nuanced than that (obviously) and the author acknowledges as much right at the end: \"If you randomly select a hundred people off the street and have them race a marathon, the finishing order will mostly depend on easily measured physiological parameters like VO\u2082max. If, on the other hand, you\u2019re comparing a mostly homogeneous group of people, like Olympic marathoners, the physical differences will be much subtler, so the mind will begin to play a role.\" For me, this was an incredibly fascinating read through a lot of the science behind what role your brain plays in your overall endurance. It's not the only factor by any means but being able to push through pain is something Navy Seal training has taught for decades and makes a lot of sense. This was easily the most highlighted book I've ever read and some of the lessons and data points will both stick with me and become part of my training. I really like the framing of the book around the Kipchoge Breaking2 effort and how these factors played into the success that day (and later in the INEOS version that broke the 2-hour barrier). Strong recommend for reading this if you are all interested in endurance sports, psychology, efficiency in things (especially the human body), or just interested in understanding how atheletes traing and push and motivate themselves. Some highlights/thoughts from my reading: 1. In a wide variety of human activity, achievement is not possible without discomfort. 2. The limits of endurance running, according to physiologists, could be quantified with three parameters: aerobic capacity, also known as VO2max, which is analogous to the size of a car\u2019s engine; running economy, which is an efficiency measure like gas mileage; and lactate threshold, which dictates how much of your engine\u2019s power you can sustain for long periods of time. 3. one of the great enigmas of endurance: John Landy. The stocky Australian is one of the most famous bridesmaids in sport, the second man in history to run a sub-four-minute mile. In the spring of 1954, after years of concerted effort, centuries of timed races, millennia of evolution, Roger Bannister beat him to it by just forty-six days. 4. To their frustration, physiologists have found that the will to endure can\u2019t be reliably tied to any single physiological variable. 5. What\u2019s crucial is the need to override what your instincts are telling you to do (slow down, back off, give up), and the sense of elapsed time. Taking a punch without flinching requires self-control, but endurance implies something more sustained: holding your finger in the flame long enough to feel the heat; filling the unforgiving minute with sixty seconds\u2019 worth of distance run. 6. most sprinters hit their top speed after 50 to 60 meters, sustain it briefly, then start to fade. Usain Bolt\u2019s ability to stride magisterially away from his competitors at the end of a race? A testament to his endurance: he\u2019s slowing down a little less (or a little later) than everyone else. In Bolt\u2019s 9.58-second world-record race at the 2009 World Championships in Berlin, his last 20 meters was five hundredths of a second slower than the previous 20 meters, but he still extended his lead over the rest of the field. 7. This is why the psychology and physiology of endurance are inextricably linked: any task lasting longer than a dozen or so seconds requires decisions, whether conscious or unconscious, on how hard to push and when. 8. As John L. Parker Jr. wrote in his cult running classic, Once a Runner, \u201cA runner is a miser, spending the pennies of his energy with great stinginess, constantly wanting to know how much he has spent and how much longer he will be expected to pay. He wants to be broke at precisely the moment he no longer needs his coin.\u201d 9. You judge what\u2019s sustainable based not only on how you feel, but on how that feeling compares to how you expected to feel at that point in the race. 10. What emerged was a mechanistic\u2014almost mathematical\u2014view of human limits: like a car with a brick on its gas pedal, you go until the tank runs out of gas or the radiator boils over, then you stop. But that\u2019s not the whole picture. 11. whether it\u2019s heat or cold, hunger or thirst, or muscles screaming with the supposed poison of \u201clactic acid,\u201d what matters in many cases is how the brain interprets these distress signals. 12. if you understand how a machine works, you can calculate its ultimate limits. 13. VO2max.(Modern scientists call it maximal oxygen uptake, since it\u2019s a measure of how much oxygen your muscles actually use rather than how much you breathe in.) 14. They drew an explicit link between the biochemical \u201csteady state\u201d of athletes like DeMar, who could run at an impressive clip for extended periods of time without obvious signs of fatigue, and the capacity of well-trained workers to put in long hours under stressful conditions without a decline in performance. 15. It was in preparing for this talk that he had his crucial epiphany about the rarity of deaths from exhaustion, like Henry Worsley\u2019s. Whatever our limits are, something must prevent us from exceeding them by too much. And that something, he reasoned, must be the brain. 16. In the final days of the record attempt, Van Deren\u2019s feet were so beat up that she had to start each day by crawling along the trail until, thanks to the familiar numbing of endorphins, she could stand up and start putting weight on them. 17. he began to assemble a coherent picture with two key planks. First, the limits we encounter during exercise aren\u2019t a consequence of failing muscles; they\u2019re imposed in advance by the brain to ensure that we never reach true failure. And second, the brain imposes these limits by controlling how much muscle is recruited at a given effort level 18. I asked Noakes for the single most convincing piece of evidence in favor of his theory, he said, without hesitation, \u201cthe end spurt.\u201d How could the runners at Comrades, after pushing themselves through 56 miles of hell, summon a finishing sprint to beat the 12-hour limit? Conventional physiology suggests that you get progressively more fatigued over the course of a run, as muscle fibers fail and fuel stores are emptied. But then, when the end is in sight, you speed up. Clearly your muscles were capable of going faster in the preceding miles; so why didn\u2019t they? \u201cThat shows that our ...more 19. \u201cperceived exertion is the single best indicator of the degree of physical strain,\u201d since it integrates information from muscles and joints, the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, and the central nervous system. 20. Perceived exertion\u2014what we\u2019ll refer to in this book as your sense of effort\u2014isn\u2019t just a proxy for what\u2019s going on in the rest of your body, he argued. It\u2019s the final arbiter, the only thing that matters. If the effort feels easy, you can go faster; if it feels too hard, you stop. That may sound obvious, or even tautological, but it\u2019s a profound statement\u2014because, as we\u2019ll discover, there are lots of ways you can alter your sense of effort, and thus your apparent physical limits, without altering what\u2019s happening in your muscles. Case in point: getting mentally fatigued increases your sense of ...more 21. Just like a smile or frown, the words in your head have the power to influence the very feelings they\u2019re supposed to reflect. 22. When Kipchoge tiptoes with exaggerated care onto the treadmill, one of the scientists edges around to the back of the machine, ready to be a spotter if needed. It\u2019s only the second time Kipchoge has run on a treadmill\u2014the first time was during the initial selection process\u2014and it\u2019s hard not to think of Bambi flailing around on the ice. Kipchoge\u2019s lab data, Jones later confides, was surprisingly ordinary, presumably because he was so uncomfortable on the treadmill. 23. top athletes are not immune to pain; they feel it like everyone else. But there were dramatic differences in pain tolerance: the national-team swimmers endured an average of 132 contractions before calling for mercy, compared to 89 in the club swimmers and 70 in the nonathletes. The differences, Gijsbers suggested, must result from the systematic exposure to intense but intermittent pain during training\u2014perhaps by harnessing brain chemicals like endorphins, or perhaps simply thanks to psychological coping mechanisms. \u201cIt is reported,\u201d he noted drily, \u201cthat pain can be strangely satisfying to ...more 24. simply getting fitter doesn\u2019t magically increase your pain tolerance. How you get fit matters: you have to suffer. 25. pain in training leads to greater tourniquet tolerance, and greater tourniquet tolerance predicts better race performance. 26. giving well-trained cyclists 1,500 milligrams of acetaminophen\u2014plain old Tylenol\u2014boosted their performance in a 10-mile time trial by about 2 percent compared to when they were given a placebo. The drugged cyclists were able to push to a higher heart rate and accumulate higher levels of lactate in their blood, while their perceived effort remained the same as during the placebo ride. Less pain made the effort feel easier, allowing the cyclists to push closer to their true physiological limits, the researchers argued. 27. One of the most familiar is lactate threshold, the point at which you\u2019re working hard enough that levels of lactate in your blood start creeping inexorably upward. A more recently developed concept is critical power, which is the point beyond which your muscles can no longer stay in the sustainable \u201csteady state\u201d equilibrium fetishized by Harvard Fatigue Laboratory researchers. Sixty minutes of all-out exercise, for a well-trained athlete, sits in the excruciating gap between these two markers, 28. The drug was an early version of crystal methamphetamine, and German military officials took a keen interest in the results. They piloted Pervitin later that year on military drivers deployed in the invasion of Poland, which triggered World War II; convinced of its usefulness, the Nazis distributed it to all branches of the military. Between April and July 1940 alone, more than 35 million tablets of \u201cPanzerschokolade\u201d (tank chocolate) fueled the Blitzkrieg across Europe, spurring lasting rumors of a Nazi superpill that gave soldiers extraordinary powers. (The dark aftereffects of crystal meth ...more 29. his Tor des G\u00e9ants subjects, who took more than 100 hours, on average, to complete the race, ended up losing just 25 percent of their pre-race leg strength\u2014a result that, on the surface, makes little sense. \u201cOkay,\u201d Millet jokes, \u201cso if I run 200 miles, I\u2019m less fatigued than if I run 100 miles!\u201d This counterintuitive finding, on its own, already hints that leg muscles aren\u2019t what ultimately limit ultra-endurance athletes. 30. At the point of exhaustion in a long endurance challenge, the legs are merely unwilling, not incapable. 31. In hilly mountain races, the microscopic muscle damage inflicted with each stride is magnified by the jarring eccentric muscle contractions as you race downhill (a drama that plays out in miniature in the early downhill miles of the Boston Marathon every April). If your legs aren\u2019t hardened against the rigors of downhill running, your muscles really will limit your speed\u2014but as a result of structural damage, and the associated pain and loss of coordination, rather than ordinary fatigue. 32. Only twice in that time has an 800-meter record been set with a faster second lap, which is the opposite of what is seen in longer races. In fact, the three-second improvement in the record since the 1960s is almost entirely due to runners speeding through a faster first lap; the second lap has stayed nearly constant, suggesting some sort of physiological limit for sprinting on fatigued legs. 33. Another key part of the dive reflex is massive peripheral vasoconstriction: the blood vessels in your arms and legs squeeze nearly shut, sending blood flooding back to your core, where it maintains the crucial oxygen supply to your heart and brain for as long as possible. This shift of blood volume to your torso also helps your lungs resist collapse under the pressure of deep dives, since fluids (unlike air) are nearly incompressible. All it takes to trigger these changes is dunking your face in cool water; in fact, the sensors appear to be primarily around the nose, lending credence to the ...more 34. The spleen mainly acts as a blood filter, but it also holds a reservoir of oxygen-rich red blood cells that can be deployed in emergencies. In seals, the organ is basically a natural scuba tank: it can hold more than twenty liters of red blood cells, and during dives it contracts like a wrung-out sponge, shrinking by 85 percent as it pushes the blood into circulation. 35. \u201canticipatory regulation\u201d: your brain uses knowledge that is gathered consciously, like an impending dive or a looming finish line, to activate or deactivate safety mechanisms that are otherwise purely unconscious. 36. One of the key researchers on the performance-enhancing effects of oxygen? A guy named Roger Bannister, who published \u201cThe Effects on the Respiration and Performance During Exercise of Adding Oxygen to the Inspired Air\u201d in the Journal of Physiology just over two months after breaking the four-minute-mile barrier in 1954. Boosting the air\u2019s oxygen content from the standard 21 percent to 66 percent, he found, allowed him to double his time to exhaustion on a steep uphill treadmill test. 37. In 2008, they adopted a simpler and more practical approach, shipping seven slushie machines to Beijing and deploying them at the venues for track, cycling, soccer, triathlon, and several other sports. Just as the transformation of liquid water to vapor cools your skin when you sweat, the \u201cphase change energy\u201d of ice melting to water in your stomach provides an extra cooling boost beyond what you would get from simply drinking a cold drink. Tests by Australian sports scientists showed that a crushed ice slurry sweetened to the same degree as a sports drink could lower core temperatures by one ...more 38. There\u2019s a reason athletes don ice-filled vests and cooling sleeves and drape ice towels over their necks: these interventions don\u2019t alter your core temperature, but they do influence how hot you feel\u2014and that, in turn, dictates how hard you\u2019re able to push. Further evidence that perception is reality: a British study in 2012 showed that cyclists in a heat chamber went 4 percent faster when the thermometer was rigged to display a falsely low temperature (79 instead of 89 degrees Fahrenheit). 39. In 1990, the average top-100 runner had clocked in at just over 5\u02b98\u02ba and 131 pounds; by 2011, those numbers had dropped to under 5\u02b97\u02ba and 124 pounds. The reason, the researchers suspected, was simple: the heavier you are, the more heat you generate while running around. Tall people also have more skin surface area, which allows them to shed more heat by sweating\u2014but the extra weight swamps the effects of the extra skin, putting bigger and taller runners at a subtle disadvantage. 40. When you fail to replace lost fluids, you start craving a drink, and your kidneys begin reabsorbing fluid that would otherwise become urine. If that\u2019s not enough to restore your internal balance, fluid will start draining out of your cells and into your veins and arteries to maintain the necessary volume of blood pumping through your body. These adjustments will buy you some time, but eventually your blood will get so concentrated that your brain will start shrinking as fluid is sucked out by osmosis, tearing delicate cerebral veins and ultimately killing you. 41. The chemical reactions involved in burning fat and carbohydrate produce two key by-products: carbon dioxide, which you breathe out, and water\u2014which actually adds to the amount of fluid available in your body. Even more significant, your body stores carbohydrate in your muscles in a form that locks away about three grams of water for every gram of carbohydrate. This water isn\u2019t available to contribute to essential cellular processes until you start unlocking the carbohydrate stores, so your body sees it as \u201cnew\u201d water when it\u2019s released during exercise.

It worked: simply having the sports drink in your mouth seemed to be more important than getting it into your bloodstream and to your muscles. It\u2019s important to note that these studies were placebo-controlled: the drinks all tasted the same. 48. The sweet taste of sugar, in other words, is not enough to trigger the benefits. Instead, the mouth appears to contain previously unknown (and as yet unidentified) sensors that relay the presence of carbohydrate directly to the brain. In Tim Noakes\u2019s central governor framework, it\u2019s as if the brain relaxes its safety margin when it knows (or is tricked into believing) that more fuel is on the way. 49. If you want running at 5:00-mile pace to feel easier, you should head out the door and run at 5:00-mile pace\u2014a lot. Over time, your heart will get stronger, your muscles will grow more energy-producing mitochondria, and you\u2019ll sprout new capillaries to distribute oxygen-rich blood. These changes will allow you to sustain 5:00 pace with less physiological strain, and they\u2019ll also attenuate the distress signals that your muscles and heart send back to the brain. The pace will feel easier, so you\u2019ll be able to sustain it for longer. 50. ultra-runners have a higher pain tolerance than nonathletes, and even over the course of a single year the pain tolerance of athletes waxes and wanes with training cycles.

Which sounds like you could go skiing naked if you got a good hat.\u201d (link) and that is similar to what I feel this book is trying to say: The brain controls how and when your body gives up so training the brain has the best impact on performance. In reality, it's much more nuanced than that (obviously) and the author acknowledges as much right at the end: \"If you randomly select a hundred people off the street and have them race a marathon, the finishing order will mostly depend on easily measured physiological parameters like VO\u2082max. If, on the other hand, you\u2019re comparing a mostly homogeneous group of people, like Olympic marathoners, the physical differences will be much subtler, so the mind will begin to play a role.\" For me, this was an incredibly fascinating read through a lot of the science behind what role your brain plays in your overall endurance. It's not the only factor by any means but being able to push through pain is something Navy Seal training has taught for decades and makes a lot of sense. This was easily the most highlighted book I've ever read and some of the lessons and data points will both stick with me and become part of my training. I really like the framing of the book around the Kipchoge Breaking2 effort and how these factors played into the success that day (and later in the INEOS version that broke the 2-hour barrier). Strong recommend for reading this if you are all interested in endurance sports, psychology, efficiency in things (especially the human body), or just interested in understanding how atheletes traing and push and motivate themselves. Some highlights/thoughts from my reading: 1. In a wide variety of human activity, achievement is not possible without discomfort. 2. The limits of endurance running, according to physiologists, could be quantified with three parameters: aerobic capacity, also known as VO2max, which is analogous to the size of a car\u2019s engine; running economy, which is an efficiency measure like gas mileage; and lactate threshold, which dictates how much of your engine\u2019s power you can sustain for long periods of time. 3. one of the great enigmas of endurance: John Landy. The stocky Australian is one of the most famous bridesmaids in sport, the second man in history to run a sub-four-minute mile. In the spring of 1954, after years of concerted effort, centuries of timed races, millennia of evolution, Roger Bannister beat him to it by just forty-six days. 4. To their frustration, physiologists have found that the will to endure can\u2019t be reliably tied to any single physiological variable. 5. What\u2019s crucial is the need to override what your instincts are telling you to do (slow down, back off, give up), and the sense of elapsed time. Taking a punch without flinching requires self-control, but endurance implies something more sustained: holding your finger in the flame long enough to feel the heat; filling the unforgiving minute with sixty seconds\u2019 worth of distance run. 6. most sprinters hit their top speed after 50 to 60 meters, sustain it briefly, then start to fade. Usain Bolt\u2019s ability to stride magisterially away from his competitors at the end of a race? A testament to his endurance: he\u2019s slowing down a little less (or a little later) than everyone else. In Bolt\u2019s 9.58-second world-record race at the 2009 World Championships in Berlin, his last 20 meters was five hundredths of a second slower than the previous 20 meters, but he still extended his lead over the rest of the field. 7. This is why the psychology and physiology of endurance are inextricably linked: any task lasting longer than a dozen or so seconds requires decisions, whether conscious or unconscious, on how hard to push and when. 8. As John L. Parker Jr. wrote in his cult running classic, Once a Runner, \u201cA runner is a miser, spending the pennies of his energy with great stinginess, constantly wanting to know how much he has spent and how much longer he will be expected to pay. He wants to be broke at precisely the moment he no longer needs his coin.\u201d 9. You judge what\u2019s sustainable based not only on how you feel, but on how that feeling compares to how you expected to feel at that point in the race. 10. What emerged was a mechanistic\u2014almost mathematical\u2014view of human limits: like a car with a brick on its gas pedal, you go until the tank runs out of gas or the radiator boils over, then you stop. But that\u2019s not the whole picture. 11. whether it\u2019s heat or cold, hunger or thirst, or muscles screaming with the supposed poison of \u201clactic acid,\u201d what matters in many cases is how the brain interprets these distress signals. 12. if you understand how a machine works, you can calculate its ultimate limits. 13. VO2max.(Modern scientists call it maximal oxygen uptake, since it\u2019s a measure of how much oxygen your muscles actually use rather than how much you breathe in.) 14. They drew an explicit link between the biochemical \u201csteady state\u201d of athletes like DeMar, who could run at an impressive clip for extended periods of time without obvious signs of fatigue, and the capacity of well-trained workers to put in long hours under stressful conditions without a decline in performance. 15. It was in preparing for this talk that he had his crucial epiphany about the rarity of deaths from exhaustion, like Henry Worsley\u2019s. Whatever our limits are, something must prevent us from exceeding them by too much. And that something, he reasoned, must be the brain. 16. In the final days of the record attempt, Van Deren\u2019s feet were so beat up that she had to start each day by crawling along the trail until, thanks to the familiar numbing of endorphins, she could stand up and start putting weight on them. 17. he began to assemble a coherent picture with two key planks. First, the limits we encounter during exercise aren\u2019t a consequence of failing muscles; they\u2019re imposed in advance by the brain to ensure that we never reach true failure. And second, the brain imposes these limits by controlling how much muscle is recruited at a given effort level 18. I asked Noakes for the single most convincing piece of evidence in favor of his theory, he said, without hesitation, \u201cthe end spurt.\u201d How could the runners at Comrades, after pushing themselves through 56 miles of hell, summon a finishing sprint to beat the 12-hour limit? Conventional physiology suggests that you get progressively more fatigued over the course of a run, as muscle fibers fail and fuel stores are emptied. But then, when the end is in sight, you speed up. Clearly your muscles were capable of going faster in the preceding miles; so why didn\u2019t they? \u201cThat shows that our ...more 19. \u201cperceived exertion is the single best indicator of the degree of physical strain,\u201d since it integrates information from muscles and joints, the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, and the central nervous system. 20. Perceived exertion\u2014what we\u2019ll refer to in this book as your sense of effort\u2014isn\u2019t just a proxy for what\u2019s going on in the rest of your body, he argued. It\u2019s the final arbiter, the only thing that matters. If the effort feels easy, you can go faster; if it feels too hard, you stop. That may sound obvious, or even tautological, but it\u2019s a profound statement\u2014because, as we\u2019ll discover, there are lots of ways you can alter your sense of effort, and thus your apparent physical limits, without altering what\u2019s happening in your muscles. Case in point: getting mentally fatigued increases your sense of ...more 21. Just like a smile or frown, the words in your head have the power to influence the very feelings they\u2019re supposed to reflect. 22. When Kipchoge tiptoes with exaggerated care onto the treadmill, one of the scientists edges around to the back of the machine, ready to be a spotter if needed. It\u2019s only the second time Kipchoge has run on a treadmill\u2014the first time was during the initial selection process\u2014and it\u2019s hard not to think of Bambi flailing around on the ice. Kipchoge\u2019s lab data, Jones later confides, was surprisingly ordinary, presumably because he was so uncomfortable on the treadmill. 23. top athletes are not immune to pain; they feel it like everyone else. But there were dramatic differences in pain tolerance: the national-team swimmers endured an average of 132 contractions before calling for mercy, compared to 89 in the club swimmers and 70 in the nonathletes. The differences, Gijsbers suggested, must result from the systematic exposure to intense but intermittent pain during training\u2014perhaps by harnessing brain chemicals like endorphins, or perhaps simply thanks to psychological coping mechanisms. \u201cIt is reported,\u201d he noted drily, \u201cthat pain can be strangely satisfying to ...more 24. simply getting fitter doesn\u2019t magically increase your pain tolerance. How you get fit matters: you have to suffer. 25. pain in training leads to greater tourniquet tolerance, and greater tourniquet tolerance predicts better race performance. 26. giving well-trained cyclists 1,500 milligrams of acetaminophen\u2014plain old Tylenol\u2014boosted their performance in a 10-mile time trial by about 2 percent compared to when they were given a placebo. The drugged cyclists were able to push to a higher heart rate and accumulate higher levels of lactate in their blood, while their perceived effort remained the same as during the placebo ride. Less pain made the effort feel easier, allowing the cyclists to push closer to their true physiological limits, the researchers argued. 27. One of the most familiar is lactate threshold, the point at which you\u2019re working hard enough that levels of lactate in your blood start creeping inexorably upward. A more recently developed concept is critical power, which is the point beyond which your muscles can no longer stay in the sustainable \u201csteady state\u201d equilibrium fetishized by Harvard Fatigue Laboratory researchers. Sixty minutes of all-out exercise, for a well-trained athlete, sits in the excruciating gap between these two markers, 28. The drug was an early version of crystal methamphetamine, and German military officials took a keen interest in the results. They piloted Pervitin later that year on military drivers deployed in the invasion of Poland, which triggered World War II; convinced of its usefulness, the Nazis distributed it to all branches of the military. Between April and July 1940 alone, more than 35 million tablets of \u201cPanzerschokolade\u201d (tank chocolate) fueled the Blitzkrieg across Europe, spurring lasting rumors of a Nazi superpill that gave soldiers extraordinary powers. (The dark aftereffects of crystal meth ...more 29. his Tor des G\u00e9ants subjects, who took more than 100 hours, on average, to complete the race, ended up losing just 25 percent of their pre-race leg strength\u2014a result that, on the surface, makes little sense. \u201cOkay,\u201d Millet jokes, \u201cso if I run 200 miles, I\u2019m less fatigued than if I run 100 miles!\u201d This counterintuitive finding, on its own, already hints that leg muscles aren\u2019t what ultimately limit ultra-endurance athletes. 30. At the point of exhaustion in a long endurance challenge, the legs are merely unwilling, not incapable. 31. In hilly mountain races, the microscopic muscle damage inflicted with each stride is magnified by the jarring eccentric muscle contractions as you race downhill (a drama that plays out in miniature in the early downhill miles of the Boston Marathon every April). If your legs aren\u2019t hardened against the rigors of downhill running, your muscles really will limit your speed\u2014but as a result of structural damage, and the associated pain and loss of coordination, rather than ordinary fatigue. 32. Only twice in that time has an 800-meter record been set with a faster second lap, which is the opposite of what is seen in longer races. In fact, the three-second improvement in the record since the 1960s is almost entirely due to runners speeding through a faster first lap; the second lap has stayed nearly constant, suggesting some sort of physiological limit for sprinting on fatigued legs. 33. Another key part of the dive reflex is massive peripheral vasoconstriction: the blood vessels in your arms and legs squeeze nearly shut, sending blood flooding back to your core, where it maintains the crucial oxygen supply to your heart and brain for as long as possible. This shift of blood volume to your torso also helps your lungs resist collapse under the pressure of deep dives, since fluids (unlike air) are nearly incompressible. All it takes to trigger these changes is dunking your face in cool water; in fact, the sensors appear to be primarily around the nose, lending credence to the ...more 34. The spleen mainly acts as a blood filter, but it also holds a reservoir of oxygen-rich red blood cells that can be deployed in emergencies. In seals, the organ is basically a natural scuba tank: it can hold more than twenty liters of red blood cells, and during dives it contracts like a wrung-out sponge, shrinking by 85 percent as it pushes the blood into circulation. 35. \u201canticipatory regulation\u201d: your brain uses knowledge that is gathered consciously, like an impending dive or a looming finish line, to activate or deactivate safety mechanisms that are otherwise purely unconscious. 36. One of the key researchers on the performance-enhancing effects of oxygen? A guy named Roger Bannister, who published \u201cThe Effects on the Respiration and Performance During Exercise of Adding Oxygen to the Inspired Air\u201d in the Journal of Physiology just over two months after breaking the four-minute-mile barrier in 1954. Boosting the air\u2019s oxygen content from the standard 21 percent to 66 percent, he found, allowed him to double his time to exhaustion on a steep uphill treadmill test. 37. In 2008, they adopted a simpler and more practical approach, shipping seven slushie machines to Beijing and deploying them at the venues for track, cycling, soccer, triathlon, and several other sports. Just as the transformation of liquid water to vapor cools your skin when you sweat, the \u201cphase change energy\u201d of ice melting to water in your stomach provides an extra cooling boost beyond what you would get from simply drinking a cold drink. Tests by Australian sports scientists showed that a crushed ice slurry sweetened to the same degree as a sports drink could lower core temperatures by one ...more 38. There\u2019s a reason athletes don ice-filled vests and cooling sleeves and drape ice towels over their necks: these interventions don\u2019t alter your core temperature, but they do influence how hot you feel\u2014and that, in turn, dictates how hard you\u2019re able to push. Further evidence that perception is reality: a British study in 2012 showed that cyclists in a heat chamber went 4 percent faster when the thermometer was rigged to display a falsely low temperature (79 instead of 89 degrees Fahrenheit). 39. In 1990, the average top-100 runner had clocked in at just over 5\u02b98\u02ba and 131 pounds; by 2011, those numbers had dropped to under 5\u02b97\u02ba and 124 pounds.

At times, it seemed like the entire notion of the book came from a web crawler project the author helped create to evaluate the connectedness of the internet. What's interesting, and really the main takeaway for me, is that almost everything is some form of a graph and knowing the specific type of graph and it's properties/incentives can provide valuable insight to influence outcomes and efficiently place resources.

I remember a lot from those times and the history museums we would visit on class trips. I don't have that same context for the Northwest and Seattle specifically. This was a really great dive into the origins of the city but told more from the perspective of Native American's that were already here. Having lived here almost 15 years now, the locations, names, and events resonated with me and I could start to add context to those in my head. The writing style was a little difficult to read at times at it provided a lot fo description and longer sentences than I am used to reading on the regular. The Seattle-area incorporates much more native imagry, names, and traditions than places I have lived before and this book provides a great representation to why that is, even from the first \"Bostons\". Some highlights/thoughts from my reading: Iconic western writer William Kittredge has described how stories and places are connected: Places come to exist in our imaginations because of stories, and so do we. When we reach for a \u201csense of place,\u201d we posit an intimate relationship to a set of stories connected to a particular location, such as Hong Kong or the Grand Canyon or the bed where we were born, thinking of histories and the evolution of personalities in a local context. Having \u201ca sense of self\u201d means possessing a set of stories about who we are and with whom and why. The restless Indian dead confirm the city\u2019s storyline, which is this: Native history and urban history\u2014and, indeed, Indians and cities\u2014cannot coexist, and one must necessarily be eclipsed by the other. They make Pike Place Market\u2019s public restrooms one of the city\u2019s \u201ctrue\u201d landmarks according to one local alternative weekly, because the toilets are \u201cthe one place where bustling tourists, drunken Indians, and desperate junkies come together \u2026 in a sort of cultural nexus, representing all that is truly great about this fine city.\u201d natural historian Stephen Jay Gould argued that stories about beginnings \u201ccome in only two basic modes. An entity either has an explicit point of origin, a specific time and place of creation, or else it evolves and has no definable moment of entry into the world.\u201d WHEN THE DENNY PARTY LANDED at the point, they called it neither Prairie Point nor Seattle. Instead, the tiny American outpost was christened New York. Over time, it would come to be known as New York\u2013Alki, a moniker meaning \u201cNew York by-and-by\u201d or \u201cNew York eventually\u201d in the local lingua franca of Chinook Jargon. the naming of Seattle is typically portrayed in civic historiography as a critical turning point: a handing over from the indigenous to the urban. On a more symbolic level, however, illahee, a Chinook Jargon term meaning \u201ccountry\u201d or \u201cplace\u201d or \u201chome,\u201d suggested a truth about everyday life in early Seattle: it was as much an indigenous place as a settler one. David Kellogg, who arrived in Seattle in the Such spirals of violence took place when indigenous notions of justice, which often mandated retaliation, coincided with a powerful strain of vigilantism in settler society. Recalling the Mesatchie Jim case, for example, mill owner Henry Yesler described the effects of \u201clower class\u201d emigrants on Indian-white relations, noting that \u201cwhenever there was trouble it was the fault of some worthless white man.\u201d The absence of a federal government capable of consistently enforcing its own Indian policies, along with the necessity of Indian labor, meant that the people of Seattle\u2014settler and indigenous alike\u2014had to craft their own strategies for dealing with each other in the first years of the town\u2019s existence. Ling Fu\u2019s brief trial symbolizes the ways in which settlers\u2014Boston, Chinese, and others\u2014had been transformed by their life in Seattle Illahee. Accounts of Seattle\u2019s \u201cvillage period\u201d are full of settlers speaking Chinook Jargon and sometimes even Whulshootseed; of white men and women learning indigenous subsistence practices from their Native neighbors and employees; and of people from places like Illinois and Ireland, Gloucester and Guangzhou, learning to accommodate Indians\u2019 insistence on participation in urban life. Nearly thirty years after Seattle\u2019s founding, Native people were still in town, and their participation in urban life had changed the Bostons as well. The mad house known as the Illahee might have been destroyed, but the larger Seattle Illahee, in which indigenous lives were woven into the urban fabric, remained, even as Seattle stood perched on the brink of an urban revolution. In many ways, 1880 was a brief interlude between two dark periods in Seattle\u2019s Indian history. The chaotic violence of earlier decades had largely quieted, the epidemics had waned, and the legality of Native homesteading allowed for some semblance of independence and economic stability. But the urban ambition reflected in Mr. Glover\u2019s bird\u2019s-eye drawing of Seattle, and the changes attendant to it, were about to reach new heights, and indigenous people who had worried themselves into the tight weave of the city\u2019s rapidly urbanizing landscape would face challenges on a completely new scale. Fire, water, and iron would soon change everything. The Great Fire of 1889 had spurred growth in West Seattle, which in turn encouraged the fiery ouster of indigenous people living in places slated for \u201cimprovement.\u201d \u201cwhen the settlers came, they drove us away and then they destroy the house and even set fires to get us away from these villages.\u201d As more and more newcomers arrived, many indigenous people were pushed aside, their services no longer necessary. For the Duwamish man Dzakwoos, who had kept a homestead on Lake Union, the loss of work forced him to abandon his homestead and relocate to the east, where he would become part of a Native community living at Monohan on Lake Sammamish, where mill jobs remained. This community would come to be part of the modern-day Snoqualmie Tribe, and present-day tribal members understand the changing demographics and economy in and around Seattle as a key reason for the development of this new community. Snoqualmie elder Ed Davis recalled, for example, that the people at Monohan, including Dzakwoos and his extended family, \u201call come together when they run out of jobs.\u201d SEATTLE IS A BAD PLACE to build a city. Steep hills of crumbly sand atop slippery clay, a winding river with a wide estuary and expansive tidal flats, ice age kettle lakes and bogs, and plunging ravines and creeks are all sandwiched between Puget Sound and vast, deep Lake Washington. But it was built anyway, despite all this, and today Seattle\u2019s watersheds in particular are among its most transformed landscapes: where four rivers once joined to become the Duwamish, now only one flows; Lake Washington empties to the west instead of the south and is shallower; other lakes, creeks, and beaches have been filled, dredged, culverted, and bulkheaded. In the last decade of the nineteenth century and the first two decades of the twentieth\u2014roughly the same years that the \u201clast\u201d Indians populated Seattle headlines\u2014the city undertook a series of massive engineering projects that turned hills into islands, straightened one river and obliterated another, and reshaped entire watersheds, driven by what one urban scholar has called the \u201cleveling impulse.\u201d In a pattern that had begun with the old Lava Beds and that would continue into the late twentieth century, Indianness became a marker of urban disorder. In the case of Thomson, Chittenden, and their fellow Changers, though, those in charge of landscape change were more likely to ignore indigenous people altogether. Arthur Denny might have been Seattle\u2019s founding father, but Seeathl\u2014generous toward the settlers at Alki, powerfully articulate during treaty negotiations, and unswervingly loyal during the \u201cIndian War\u201d\u2014was its patron saint. Nowhere was this more obvious than in the bad poetry inspired by visits to his grave. these activists had pursued what she called \u201cthe city mode.\u201d Its confrontational strategies and connections to other minority communities\u2014especially African Americans and antiwar radicals\u2014alienated some older activists. This same tension would also arise on reservations as Indian men and women, energized by leftist tactics honed primarily in urban places, brought those visions of revolution back to their home communities. But for the Duwamish, a greater offense was yet to come. In 1979, five years after his decision in United States v. Washington, Judge Boldt determined that the Duwamish and four other Puget Sound Native communities no longer met all of the seven criteria required for inclusion on the list of tribes eligible for treaty fishing rights. In the case of the Duwamish, the disqualifier was an apparent ten-year break in the tribe\u2019s political leadership (one of the seven criteria required showing continuous tribal organization from the signing of a treaty to the present). The decade in question stretched from 1916 to 1925, the years immediately after the completion of the Lake Washington Ship Canal and the destruction of the Black River, where many Duwamish people had still been living. The chaos of those years now had its consequences some six decades later. on the last day of the Clinton administration, Cecile Hansen received a phone call from the Bureau of Indian Affairs, telling her that the Duwamish had been recognized. The victory was short-lived, however; only a few days later, the new Bureau of Indian Affairs administrator appointed by George W. Bush informed Hansen that the decision had been reversed. Like other Indian images in Seattle\u2019s past, these stories were not really about Native people at all. That is exactly the point: even today, Indians in Seattle are often more visible as metaphors than as people. But restoration of indigenous places is deeply problematic: there is no guarantee that the salmon or anything else can be brought back or that such efforts will actually improve the material conditions of modern Indian lives. The question remains, then: good intentions aside, whom do these place-stories of \u201crestoration\u201d truly benefit? To when, and to whom, is what being restored, exactly?","title":"Review of Native Seattle: Histories from the Crossing-Over Place by Coll Thrush"},{"location":"archive/books/native-seattle/#review-of-native-seattle-histories-from-the-crossing-over-place-by-coll-thrush","text":"Book Link: Amazon (smile) Growing up in Michigan, every (or maybe most?) school has a local history section that they teach every 2-3 grades.

There are adventures and discoveries along the way about themselves and the storytelling is pretty engaging overall. There was one part in particular that resonated strongly with me: \"Maybe life is just carrying the news. Survivng to carry the news. Maybe we have just one message, and it is delivered to us when we are born and we are never sure what it says; it may have nothing to do with us personally but it must be carried by hand through a life, all the way, and at the end handed over, sealed. I saw that this is now a movie on Netflix staring Tom Hanks as Captain Kidd and upon seeing that I realized I had been picturing Tom Hanks as this character all along. Perfect casting.","title":"Review of News of The World"},{"location":"archive/books/parable-of-the-sower/","text":"Review of Parable of the Sower Book Link: https://smile.amazon.com/Parable-Sower-Octavia-Butler-ebook/dp/B008HALO4Q/ Not only is this book very well written, it somehow portrays the current and upcoming crises of global warming, wealth inequality, police state, fascism, and the struggle to survive in the world incredible accuracy despite being written in the 1990s.

That is a lot of value and it never hurts to have more evidence when making claims or lobbying for changes to the status quo. My main issue was that it's not clear who this book was written for. The title and set up makes it seem like the author is laying out a blueprint for how things need to change and not just what needs to change. My guess is that the bulk of the audience interested in reading this will already be familiar with climate change and its impact and risks as well as the vision for the future where these risks are mitigated. Only speaking to the what and why here and not the how is a huge gap that makes me feel like I spent time reinforcing my own beliefs or collecting a few more data points. I think it is a missed opportunity with a captive and supportive audience to layout a blueprint for these changes. Even more, given a clear connection between the what, why, and how you may even be able to sway some initially skeptical people to your viewpoint and vision. All that said, I do think the author spelled out a framework at the end that resonated with me and my own journey through being involved and working on climate change. It was called the \"Six Steps to Making a Difference\": Discover your own purpose Do something now Bring your values to work Work in government Get political Take care of yourself and remember to find joy I am currenly somewhere between 4 and 5 even though I don't work directly for government but more in the regulatory reporting space. I think step six should really be seen as step 1b, 2b, 3b, 4b, and 5b though as I see a lot of people in this space seeing the reality of the data and lack of motiviation and action from those with the power to change and falling into sad, depressed, and hopeless states (raises my own hand). It's hard to stay positive and find joy so reinforcing it at every step feels like a framing that would reinforce the step that helps us continue on in the framework. Some highlights from my reading: 1. embracing a pro-social purpose beyond profit maximization and taking responsibility for the health of the natural and social systems on which we all rely not only makes good business sense but is also morally required by the same commitments to freedom and prosperity that drove our original embrace of shareholder value. 2. Taken literally, a single-minded focus on profit maximization would seem to require that firms not only jack up drug prices but also fish out the oceans, destabilize the climate, fight against anything that might raise labor costs\u2014including public funding of education and health care, and (my personal favorite) attempt to rig the political process in their own favor. In the words of the cartoon: \u201cYes, the planet got destroyed, but for a beautiful moment in time we created a lot of value for shareholders.\u201d 3. Free markets only work their magic when prices reflect all available information, when there is genuine freedom of opportunity, and when the rules of the game support genuine competition. In today\u2019s world many prices are wildly out of whack, freedom of opportunity is increasingly confined to the well connected, and firms are rewriting the rules of the game in ways that maximize their own profits while simultaneously distorting the market. 4. the real cost of a kilowatt-hour of coal-fired electricity is thus not 5\u00a2 but something more like 13\u00a2. This means we are only paying about 40 percent of the real costs of burning coal. Fossil fuel energy looks cheap\u2014but only because we\u2019re not counting the costs we are imposing on our neighbors and on the future. 5. As long as investors care only about maximizing their own returns, and focus only on the short term and on what can be easily measured, firms will be reluctant to take the risks inherent in seeking to exploit shared value and to embrace high road labor practices. 6. nearly three-quarters of consumers claimed that they would change their consumption habits to reduce their impact on the environment.15 Nearly half claimed to be willing to forgo a popular brand name for an environmentally friendly product.16 7. By 2017 Walmart had met its goal of doubling the transportation fleet\u2019s efficiency and was saving more than a billion dollars a year in transportation costs\u2014around 4 percent of net income. Walmart doesn\u2019t release detailed investment figures, but in 2007 and 2009 we know that it was spending about $500 million on increasing energy efficiency and reducing GHG emissions. If it continued to spend at about this rate\u2014and if the only benefits from this spending were the increased trucking efficiency\u2014then my back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that it received at least a 13 percent rate of return on its capital\u2014at a time when many retail companies scramble to make 5 or 6 percent. Over the same period, Walmart has also increased the energy efficiency of its stores by 12 percent, which\u2014again by my back-of-the-envelope conversion\u2014is currently saving them about $250 million a year. 8. organizational purpose is the key to change. Those firms that have a clearly defined purpose beyond profit maximization, where it is clearly understood that the purpose of the firm is not to make shareholders rich, but to build great products in the service of the social good\u2014these are the firms that have the courage and the skills to navigate transformation. 9. Some people think greed is good. But over and over it\u2019s proven that ultimately generosity is better. \u2014PAUL POLMAN, RETIRED CEO OF UNILEVER1 10. The widespread adoption of authentic purpose\u2014a clear, collective sense of a company\u2019s goals that reaches beyond simply making money and is rooted in deeply held common values and embedded in the firm\u2019s strategy and organization\u2014is an essential step toward reimagining capitalism. 11. Employees who are deeply identified with the firm\u2019s purpose share a common set of goals. They are also likely to be significantly more \u201cpro-social\u201d\u2014that is, to be temperamentally inclined to trust others and to enjoy working with them. Teams that share common goals and that are composed of individuals who are truly authentic, fundamentally prosocial, and intrinsically motivated find it easier to communicate and align their activities, to trust each other, and to create a sense of \u201cpsychological safety\u201d\u2014all attributes that drive high performance, and the ability to take risks and to learn from each other. 12. The contrast between the gleaming white structures of the fair and the filth of downtown Chicago has been credited with helping to start the civic improvement movement that emerged in the last decade of the century\u2014a movement inspired by the idea that cities could be as clean and healthy as the White City. But Chicago didn\u2019t effectively address its air pollution problems until the 1960s. 13. Energy demand is projected to double over the next fifty years.2 Stopping global warming means ensuring that every new plant that\u2019s built is carbon-free. It also means shutting down or decarbonizing the world\u2019s existing fossil fuel infrastructure. These are tasks that only government action\u2014whether it\u2019s in the form of a carbon tax or simple regulation\u2014can achieve. Business was able to make real progress in slowing the deforestation of the Amazon\u2014but only with government help. Now that the Brazilian government has changed its policies, rates of deforestation have skyrocketed.3 The businessmen who built the White City were only able to curb Chicago\u2019s pollution as long as they could use the threat of legal sanction to shut down polluters. Once they lost political support and juries refused to convict, the pollution returned. 14. Human history is a history not only of cruelty, but also of compassion, sacrifice, courage, kindness. What we choose to emphasize in this complex history will determine our lives. If we see only the worst, it destroys our capacity to do something. If we remember those times and places\u2014and there are so many\u2014where people have behaved magnificently, this gives us the energy to act, and at least the possibility of sending this spinning top of a world in a different direction. And if we do act, in however small a way, we don\u2019t have to wait for some grand utopian future. The future is an infinite succession of presents, and to live now as we think human beings should live, in defiance of all that is bad around us, is itself a marvelous victory. \u2014HOWARD ZINN, YOU CAN\u2019T BE NEUTRAL ON A MOVING TRAIN, 1994","title":"Review of Reimagining Capitalism in a World on Fire"},{"location":"archive/books/reimagining-capitalism-in-a-world-on-fire/#review-of-reimagining-capitalism-in-a-world-on-fire","text":"Book Link: https://www.amazon.com/Reimagining-Capitalism-World-Rebecca-Henderson-ebook/dp/B07W54CKFG/ This book contained a lot of great anecdotes and historical references paired with a good vision for how things could/should be in a world that successfully combatted climate change.

This book was that for me. It has been a very difficult past few years and has gotten more difficult recently and I have consistently turned to running as a form of meditation where I can spend hours in the mountains in my own thoughts while burning off anxiety and nervous energy. Things feel better after a long run before slowly creeping backwards as time drags on. Although I did not experience the depths that J. M. Thompson decribes here, I can absolutely relate to the feelings, emotions, and impact to your physical and mental state and how the act of running alleviates those impacts. I don't think this book will resonate with most people, but those that are having a difficult time and those that enjoy pushing their body through type-2 fun to better understand and appreciate their own abilities will likely find a deep connection. Some highlights from my reading: 1. There is a path ahead of me. Nothing is ever altogether lost. There is a ground beneath us that never goes away. 2. It\u2019s chaos, in a container: a kind of organized insanity that can help keep you sane. 3. I choose my GU flavors carefully. I think I can say that I choose everything in my pack with quite a fanatical measure of care. Head out on a really big adventure, and it pays to sweat the small stuff. 4. The unwritten manual of the human species lists certain items essential to survival. You need a good survival blanket\u2014something or someone that reflects warmth and love and caring, a blanket you can crawl under a tree with in the depth of night and wrap around you until the sun comes, a way to feel held and seen and to believe that you deserve to survive. 5. I think of my muscles and tendons and ligaments as a family on an epic road trip. There\u2019s a limit to how much the little ones can handle. 6. In our youth, Jordan argues, you contemplate infinite and impossible questions. You acquire more knowledge. But knowledge is futile unless it inspires action. Thus, you must act. Without action, you fall into pessimism. And the nature of that action is of the utmost significance. \u201cThe thing you do should be for you the most important thing in the world,\u201d writes Jordan. \u201cIf you could do something better than you are doing now, everything considered, why are you not doing it?\u201d 7. To understand the whole meaning of a book or historical period, you need to examine its component parts. Know more about the parts, and you expand your perception of the whole. Know more about the whole, and you see the parts in a new light. This cycle from whole to part and back again\u2014what the twentieth-century German philosopher Martin Heidegger called the hermeneutic circle\u2014constitutes the process of historical understanding: the loops of remembering and reinterpreting through which we understand the meaning of the past, whether collective or personal. 8. It was hard to know which was worse, the sadness or the terror. The sadness was a constant. It lurked in the background, underneath the fear, moving into the foreground of awareness when I went to bed at night, and in the lulls between the waves of fear. The fear came along with the inchoate perception that something was going very badly wrong. 9. Earth seemed to conspire to keep me alive. The island manifested marvels of almost comic-book images of natural enchantment. One afternoon I paddled out in giant surf and looked back toward the shore. A rainbow formed above a tall green mountain. Giant waves crashed all about me. I wondered if the surf was big enough to guarantee death by drowning. A double rainbow formed above the mountain. 10. When you know how far it is to the end, and there\u2019s still a long way to go, that can be a tough kind of knowledge to bear. Fixate on some future that isn\u2019t here yet, and the present is a bad place to be. Drop that fixation, and the present is neither good nor bad. It just is. 11. all things being equal, an ultramarathon is essentially an eating contest. 12. Type-one fun is sex and ice cream: you like it when it\u2019s happening. Type-two fun you like looking back on. what a relief it was to embrace the fire that ignited in my chest and heart and folded me within it, as my legs hammered the ground, and I absorbed the knowledge that the ground communicated of the earth\u2019s stable presence underneath me and the solid feeling it gave me inside. With every step forward, the house fell farther behind. And I knew that this solid feeling would always be there for me: all I had to do was put on my running shoes and get outside. I ran to build a foundation for the formless feelings inside me that I didn\u2019t understand. I ran to persuade myself that one day I would leave all the madness of my family\u2019s past behind and never look back. I ran to remember what was real. 13. We cannot step in the same river twice, Heraclitus told us. A little boy turns into a man: Were those two selves not likewise mutually distinct, separated in space and time, unlike in mind and body? And even in the present, it occurred to me, Am I not this very moment a crowd of conflicting thoughts? Is there really a still point in all this flux, a core me? No, I was a fiction too, so it wasn\u2019t at all clear to me that my mother was any different, rendering my loss of her all the more confusing: I was mourning somebody still alive. 14. Almost any trail or trial in life is traversable when you have that feeling of sanctuary. Someplace that feels like home. The place doesn\u2019t have to be physical. It\u2019s a state of mind. Someone who feels like home. The person who really knows you and loves you and you can lie on the ground with and hold and you know that everything is going to be fine. 15. Something like this experience is the origin story of many an ultrarunner. You start out thinking a regular marathon sounds pretty far enough. There is an infamous low point around mile 18 when you get low on glycogen and feel like you can\u2019t keep going: the so-called wall. But eat something, drink something, and you keep going. You hit another wall, like I did at the midpoint of that fifty-mile race. You eat something, drink something. You keep going. You can keep on going on like that for a really, really long time. 16. Knowing this has an amazing effect on what seems possible not just in running but in the rest of your life. I\u2019m going to do it. I can do things. It was a stunning revelation back then, the state I was in, to discover this. 17. It\u2019s one thing to understand the arithmetic that a fifty-mile run is in reality a bunch of one-mile runs, stacked end to end, and another thing altogether to screen out all the messages that say that something like this is i...This highlight has been truncated due to consecutive passage length restrictions. 18. I go into the bathroom to splash some water on my face and clean my teeth. I see the man in the mirror: me. English male, disheveled . . . I\u2019ve seen and thought and felt more in the past two days than the previous forty years. But there\u2019s one thing I haven\u2019t seen, because it\u2019s invisible: Me. When I look in the mirror, my perspective flips from inside looking out to outside looking in, from I to me, between the world as it shows up in my awareness and the way I show up to others. They\u2019re so unlike each other, this mirror me and I, it\u2019s almost hard to believe we\u2019re the same person. 19. There were others like her, the man said. The ultrarunners. They were crazy people. Crazy in a good way. They took their crazy and put it to use. They ran until they were on their knees and puking up their guts and crying and then they got up and kept on running. 20. Namu kie Butsu. Namu kie Ho. Namu kie So.\u201d It was Japanese that referred to the Three Refuges of Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha. Butsu is Buddha, the possibility of liberation. Ho is Dharma, the teachings about that possibility. So is Sangha, the community of people who aspire to live by those teachings. Namu kie Butsu: I take refuge in the Buddha. Namu kie Ho: I take refuge in the Dharma. Namu kie So: I take refuge in the Sangha. 21. Some years ago a group of neurobiologists assembled a group of mouse depressives.14 When a mouse is hung upside down by its tail, it tries to wriggle away. If the mouse soon abandons its escape attempt, it is understood to be depressed. The scientists put the sad mice in a playground. They had never dreamed such freedom might be possible! The mice skipped and scampered about. Their depression faded away. The scientists looked inside their brains. They were interested in a chemical called brain-derived neurotrophic factor, or BDNF. It helps new cells grow in a region of the brain called the hippocampus that underpins the capacity to learn and remember. After the mice ran out to play, they had more BDNF in their brains. Further research has shown that running has a similar effect on human brains. When you run, you remember what it feels like to be free. 22. We fall down, but we get up For a saint is just a sinner Who fell down And got up. 23. The closest term I could find to describe the feeling was what the Japanese call mono no aware, literally \u201cthe pathos of things,\u201d a bittersweet awareness of the transience of all phenomena. 24. But I had no illusions about some bright dividing line between the healthy and the sick. We are all vulnerable. In the words of Hindu guru Nisargadatta Maharaj, \u201cThere are no others.\u201d 25. Can ultrarunning, like psychedelic drugs, induce the entropic brain? Proof awaits confirmation through empirical studies. Eighty-four hours into the Tahoe 200, I sure felt like I was tripping on acid\u2014though for a while not in a positive way. I was in Dysnomia: a state of psychological anarchy, on the verge of breakdown.","title":"Review of Running Is A Kind of Dreaming: A Memoir"},{"location":"archive/books/running-is-a-kind-of-dreaming/#review-of-running-is-a-kind-of-dreaming-a-memoir","text":"Book Link: https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B08RZ4PTSF/ Every once in a while you find an music album, musician, tv show, movie, friend, or in this case a book that meets you at the perfect time.

A rainbow formed above a tall green mountain. Giant waves crashed all about me. I wondered if the surf was big enough to guarantee death by drowning. A double rainbow formed above the mountain. 10. When you know how far it is to the end, and there\u2019s still a long way to go, that can be a tough kind of knowledge to bear. Fixate on some future that isn\u2019t here yet, and the present is a bad place to be. Drop that fixation, and the present is neither good nor bad. It just is. 11. all things being equal, an ultramarathon is essentially an eating contest. 12. Type-one fun is sex and ice cream: you like it when it\u2019s happening. Type-two fun you like looking back on. what a relief it was to embrace the fire that ignited in my chest and heart and folded me within it, as my legs hammered the ground, and I absorbed the knowledge that the ground communicated of the earth\u2019s stable presence underneath me and the solid feeling it gave me inside. With every step forward, the house fell farther behind. And I knew that this solid feeling would always be there for me: all I had to do was put on my running shoes and get outside. I ran to build a foundation for the formless feelings inside me that I didn\u2019t understand. I ran to persuade myself that one day I would leave all the madness of my family\u2019s past behind and never look back. I ran to remember what was real. 13. We cannot step in the same river twice, Heraclitus told us. A little boy turns into a man: Were those two selves not likewise mutually distinct, separated in space and time, unlike in mind and body? And even in the present, it occurred to me, Am I not this very moment a crowd of conflicting thoughts? Is there really a still point in all this flux, a core me? No, I was a fiction too, so it wasn\u2019t at all clear to me that my mother was any different, rendering my loss of her all the more confusing: I was mourning somebody still alive. 14. Almost any trail or trial in life is traversable when you have that feeling of sanctuary. Someplace that feels like home. The place doesn\u2019t have to be physical. It\u2019s a state of mind. Someone who feels like home. The person who really knows you and loves you and you can lie on the ground with and hold and you know that everything is going to be fine. 15. Something like this experience is the origin story of many an ultrarunner. You start out thinking a regular marathon sounds pretty far enough. There is an infamous low point around mile 18 when you get low on glycogen and feel like you can\u2019t keep going: the so-called wall. But eat something, drink something, and you keep going. You hit another wall, like I did at the midpoint of that fifty-mile race. You eat something, drink something. You keep going. You can keep on going on like that for a really, really long time. 16. Knowing this has an amazing effect on what seems possible not just in running but in the rest of your life. I\u2019m going to do it. I can do things. It was a stunning revelation back then, the state I was in, to discover this. 17. It\u2019s one thing to understand the arithmetic that a fifty-mile run is in reality a bunch of one-mile runs, stacked end to end, and another thing altogether to screen out all the messages that say that something like this is i...This highlight has been truncated due to consecutive passage length restrictions. 18. I go into the bathroom to splash some water on my face and clean my teeth. I see the man in the mirror: me. English male, disheveled . . . I\u2019ve seen and thought and felt more in the past two days than the previous forty years. But there\u2019s one thing I haven\u2019t seen, because it\u2019s invisible: Me. When I look in the mirror, my perspective flips from inside looking out to outside looking in, from I to me, between the world as it shows up in my awareness and the way I show up to others. They\u2019re so unlike each other, this mirror me and I, it\u2019s almost hard to believe we\u2019re the same person. 19. There were others like her, the man said. The ultrarunners. They were crazy people. Crazy in a good way. They took their crazy and put it to use. They ran until they were on their knees and puking up their guts and crying and then they got up and kept on running. 20. Namu kie Butsu. Namu kie Ho. Namu kie So.\u201d It was Japanese that referred to the Three Refuges of Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha. Butsu is Buddha, the possibility of liberation. Ho is Dharma, the teachings about that possibility. So is Sangha, the community of people who aspire to live by those teachings. Namu kie Butsu: I take refuge in the Buddha. Namu kie Ho: I take refuge in the Dharma. Namu kie So: I take refuge in the Sangha. 21. Some years ago a group of neurobiologists assembled a group of mouse depressives.14 When a mouse is hung upside down by its tail, it tries to wriggle away. If the mouse soon abandons its escape attempt, it is understood to be depressed. The scientists put the sad mice in a playground. They had never dreamed such freedom might be possible! The mice skipped and scampered about. Their depression faded away. The scientists looked inside their brains. They were interested in a chemical called brain-derived neurotrophic factor, or BDNF. It helps new cells grow in a region of the brain called the hippocampus that underpins the capacity to learn and remember. After the mice ran out to play, they had more BDNF in their brains. Further research has shown that running has a similar effect on human brains. When you run, you remember what it feels like to be free. 22. We fall down, but we get up For a saint is just a sinner Who fell down And got up. 23. The closest term I could find to describe the feeling was what the Japanese call mono no aware, literally \u201cthe pathos of things,\u201d a bittersweet awareness of the transience of all phenomena. 24. But I had no illusions about some bright dividing line between the healthy and the sick. We are all vulnerable. In the words of Hindu guru Nisargadatta Maharaj, \u201cThere are no others.\u201d 25. Can ultrarunning, like psychedelic drugs, induce the entropic brain? Proof awaits confirmation through empirical studies. Eighty-four hours into the Tahoe 200, I sure felt like I was tripping on acid\u2014though for a while not in a positive way. I was in Dysnomia: a state of psychological anarchy, on the verge of breakdown.","title":"Review of Running Is A Kind of Dreaming: A Memoir"},{"location":"archive/books/station-eleven/","text":"Review of Station Eleven Book Link: Amazon (smile) I had heard about this book but was reluctant to read given its about a flu pandemic killing most people on earth, and *gestures broadly at current pandemic*.

A culture that is supported by a true sustainable vision is untethered by market shifts and leads to continuity for employees and customers. 2.

Much of our overconsumption and waste has led to the destruction of forests and water shortages. We have polluted and contaminated the earth. And it all began with the Industrial Revolution.

Farmers\u2019 report about half of the food grown is discarded simply because of the way it looks. 13. Emissions are separated in Scopes 1, 2, and 3. Scope 1: Direct emissions created from your sources or activities. These are your own heating, cooling, fleets, machines, vehicles. Scope 2: Indirect emission that is sourced from energy providers that power your office or home (simply the electricity that you purchase). Scope 3: Transferred indirect emissions. This means everything you are engaged in from disposal of trash, purchased goods which encompasses the entire supply chain including business travel of your team, electricity of the entire product lifecycle all your customers consume. 14. Take for example the University of Michigan, which has some 340 investment managers across all financial asset classes.

It focuses pretty heavy on design and architecture as that is the roots of the show, but there are some great gems in here! Would strongly recommend reading and think this is the perfect \"coffee table\" book that you can pick up, open to a random page, and learn fascinating details about the world around you.

It's a tough book to read straight through because the format is a bunch of semi-connected short blurbs about things in the world you either don't recognize or don't realize exist (or the reasons behind them). It focuses pretty heavy on design and architecture as that is the roots of the show, but there are some great gems in here! Would strongly recommend reading and think this is the perfect \"coffee table\" book that you can pick up, open to a random page, and learn fascinating details about the world around you.

This was \"assigned\" to read for work and I think it lays out an ideal workplace vision of planning for the infinite instead of the finite and provided many examples to support its case. That is, however, why I stopped reading these types of books -- they always feel like cherry picking of success stories and framing their experience and motivations to align to whatever central purpose or \"hack\" they are trying to promote. In this case, it focused heavily on businesses that (seemingly) operate for a Just Cause first, and revenue is only for funding the Just Cause of the company. I can definitely get behind that framing, and the shitting on Milton Friedman along the way made it even better. But, I can't fully commit to the belief that any publicly traded company is operating out of the goodness of their heart to fulfill a larger purpose. The whole point of going public and turning your company over to shareholders is the opposite of that. I liked the message of the book in general, and I think it has a lot of relevance to individuals and how they live and orient their lives. It also has relevance to employees and consumers to vote with their feet and wallets to support companies that operate in this way and actively stay away from companies that don't. I especially like the chapter on Ethical Fading, it was an interesting take on how I perceive mass media and social capital is flourishing on that principal. In the end, good book and would recommend reading it, but I don't fully understand why this was assigned as a work reading when most companies (and especially my current company) are not operating with these principles and at times are intentionally against them. Some highlights from my reading: 1. If we want to be as healthy as possible, the lifestyle we adopt maters more than whether or not we hit our goal on arbitrary dates we set 2. A Just Cause is not the same as our WHY. A WHY comes from the past. It is an origin story. It is a statement of who we are -- the sum total of our values and beliefs. A Just Cause is about the future. It defines where we are going. It describes the world we hope to live in and will commit to help build. 3. A Just Cause must be: For something -- affirmative and optimistic. Inclusive -- open to all those who would like to contribute. Service oriented -- for the primary benefit of others. Resilient -- able to endure political, technological, and cultural change. Idealistic -- big, bold, and ultimatelt unachievable. 4. This is what \"servant leadership\" means. It means the primary benefit of the contribution flows downstream. In an organization where service orientation is lacking (or treated as a sideshow rather than the main event), the flow of benefits tends to go upstream instead. 5. The infinite player wants to keep the game going for others. 6. \"Finite exhaustion\". Because they did well and were paid well for hitting each goal set for them, they kept repeating that pattern. At some point in their careers, they traded any fantasy of feeling like their work would contribute to something bigger than themselves for a rat race or a hamster wheel or some other unfulling running rodent metaphor. Racking up finite wins does not lead to something more infinite. 7. Just as we don't buy a car simply so we can buy more gas, so too must companies offer more value than their ability to make money. A company, like a car, is more valuable to all constituents when it takes us somewhere to which we would otherwise be unable to go. That place we envision going to is the Just Cause. 8. Even well-intended finite-minded leaders often have the perspective of \"make money to do good\". An infinite perspective on service, however, looks somewhat different: \"Do good making money\". 9. The order in which a person presents information more often than not reveals their actual priorities and the focus of their strategies. 10. The responsibility of the most senior person in an organization is to look beyond the organization. \"I will go up and out. I need you to go down and in\" is how she framed her responsibility every time she took a new command. 11. The company's interests should always be secondary to the interest of the consumer (ironically, a point Smith belived so \"self-evident\" he felt it was absurd to try to prove it, and yet here I am 12. writing a whole book about it). 13. As Henry Ford said, \"A business that makes nothing but money is a poor kind of business\" 14. When we tie pay packages directly to stock price, it promotes practices like closing factories, keeping wages down, implementing extreme cost cutting and conducting annual rounds of layoffs -- tactics that might boost the stock price in the near term, but often do damage to an organization's ability to survive and thrive in the Infinite Game. 15. The definition of the responsibility of business must: 1. Advance a purpose: Offer people a sense of belonging and a feeling that their lives and their work have value beyond their physical work. 2. Protect people: Operate our companies in a way that protects the people who work for us, the people who buy from us, and the environments in which we live and work. 3. Generate profit: Money is fuel for a business to remain viable so that it may continue to advance the first two priorities. 16. To determine the kind of person who belongs in the Navy SEALS, one of the things they do is evaluate candidates on two axes: Performance versus trust. 17. Ethical fading is about self-delusion. Anyone, regardless of their personal moral compass, can succumb to it. The leaders we point out and vilify for running their business unethically and then accepting a handsome reward for doing so don't think they've done anything wrong. And if you don't think you are doing anything wrong, what incentive do you have to do things differently? 18. When we have the courage to change our mindset from a finite view to a more infinite view, many of the decisions we make, like CVS's choice to stop selling cigarettes, seem bold to those with a more traditional view of the world.

I liked that Kara Goucher did her own narration but there were times you could tell she doesn't do this very often and the focus on annunciating her words became a bit of a distraction from the story. However, you could literally here the emotion in her voice multiple times, especially when talking about her grandfather's death, which I felt helped make the content resonate and become personable. Since this was an audiobook, I didn't get a chance to highlight sections like I usually do so I'll give some general highlights and thoughts instead. The story of her running career (the training and running specifically) was captivating and as a fellow distance runner I felt lots empathy, motivation, and commiseration throughout. Her family life was equally relatable growing up in the Midwest and moving to the PNW for work myself and having very similar thoughts and experiences. I had mixed feelings about the rest of the content with Nike, doping, and Alberto Salazar. Those things are unfortunately intertwined with her life and it took incredible bravery, conviction, and courage to come forward at the time and be willing and able to write this book in the first place. That part cannot be understated. I'm not sure how to best state this, but I wanted to learn more about Kara and her training, feelings, and motivations through her career and less about the shitty people that made her achievements that much more difficult to achieve. It's nearly impossible to truly separate the two so but it left me with mixed feelings even giving them the attention and recognition.","title":"Review of The Longest Race"},{"location":"archive/books/the-longest-race/#review-of-the-longest-race","text":"Book Link: https://www.amazon.com/Longest-Race-Inside-Deception-Running/dp/1982179147/ This was my first true audiobook listen and since I listened to it in pieces while I was driving, it definitely helped me \"read\" more and complete the book faster.

Ironically, I had strong vibes that this could/should be a movie as I was reading through due to the modern storytelling and potential visual clues and aspects of the story. In the end, this book is sort of a blend between Interstellar, Butterfly Effect, Soul, with a little Westworld thrown in and hit the sweet spot of what I was looking for -- thoroughly enjoyed it! The unexpected aspect of this story was its connection and focus on the planet and being human that are allowed and fortunate enough to live here which also resented with a lot of my current focus. Each life that Nora lived seemed to be a reflection on a component of modern society (example: Climate Change, Fame and Celebrity, physical peak and performance) which when combined together provide a commentary on not only the problems with these things but also touching on some of the good that comes of it. In the end, it is best summed up by one of the final lines in the book: \"The prison wasn't the place, but the perspective\". Whatever path you find yourself on in this life has good, bad, and everything in between. If you are true to your values, your perspective is what makes the difference. Some highlights from my reading: 1. \"The glacial landscape reminded her that she was, first and foremost, a human living on a planet\" 2. \"She and all humans were really just one of nine million species\" 3. \"'Well, it's great. An yes, I just thought I'd send a message that, you know, I am out here living my best life. But I miss home after a while.' 'Which one?' asked Marcelo, with a quietly cheeky smile. 'I mean, do you feel more at home in London, or LA, or on the Amalfi Coast?' It seemed this was the life where her carbon footprint was the highest. 4.

Some highlights from my reading: 1. The often-used phrase \u201cpay attention\u201d is apt: you dispose of a limited budget of attention that you can allocate to activities, and if you try to go beyond your budget, you will fail. 1. The gorilla study illustrates two important facts about our minds: we can be blind to the obvious, and we are also blind to our blindness. 1. Most of what you (your System 2) think and do originates in your System 1, but System 2 takes over when things get difficult, and it normally has the last word. 1. The best we can do is a compromise: learn to recognize situations in which mistakes are likely and try harder to avoid significant mistakes when the stakes are high. The premise of this book is that it is easier to recognize other people\u2019s mistakes than our own. 1. Modern tests of working memory require the individual to switch repeatedly between two demanding tasks, retaining the results of one operation while performing the other. People who do well on these tests tend to do well on tests of general intelligence. However, the ability to control attention is not simply a measure of intelligence; 1. People who experience flow describe it as \u201ca state of effortless concentration so deep that they lose their sense of time, of themselves, of their problems,\u201d 1. People who are cognitively busy are also more likely to make selfish choices, use sexist language, and make superficial judgments in social situations. 1. The bat-and-ball problem is our first encounter with an observation that will be a recurrent theme of this book: many people are overconfident, prone to place too much faith in their intuitions. They apparently find cognitive effort at least mildly unpleasant and avoid it as much as possible. 1. Intelligence is not only the ability to reason; it is also the ability to find relevant material in memory and to deploy attention when needed. 1. The general theme of these findings is that the idea of money primes individualism: a reluctance to be involved with others, to depend on others, or to accept demands from others. 1. Hearing a speaker when you are in a good mood, or even when you have a pencil stuck crosswise in your mouth to make you \u201csmile,\u201d also induces cognitive ease. 1.

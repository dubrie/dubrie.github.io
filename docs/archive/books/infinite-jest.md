Oh boy, where do I start with this. First, I knew I would never physically read this whole thing and since it was a fiction book I started listening during my commutes to work. I got through almost 33 chapters (about 30% of the book) and I cannot go any further. The story is mildly interesting, and maybe it gets better as the stories start to intertwine later (I assume?) but this was just a slog. I almost bailed about 10 chapters in when the narrator spent nearly an hour, on 1.2x speed, reading off imaginary movies and tv shows that an imaginary character produced. The dialouge was only sorta intersting and it really felt like the author was getting paid by word. I can see how this may be wildly acclaimed by critics and people really into fictional writing, but for someone like me that is looking for a compelling or thought provoking story, it wildly misses the mark.
